# HK_Protest_Analysis

This project will analyse news article covering the Hong Kong 2019 protests, with the aims of web scraping the data and applying exploratory data analysis on the scraped data.

I will be using SCMP as the news source for this project as they are one the largest Hong Kong English-language news outlet and I find them to be the most neutral on all topics.
