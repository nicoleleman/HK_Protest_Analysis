Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho sues district councillor Roy Tam for ‘inciting others’ to vandalise his branch office in Tsuen Wan during protest havoc,Pro-Beijing Ho launches civil court proceedings over attack on district office; Tam rejects ‘false and unsubstantiated’ allegations he encouraged protesters to vandalise premises,"4:40pm, 9 Aug, 2019","A viral video showed Ho shaking hands with men wearing white T-shirts and thanking them on the night in question.; The day after the attack, Ho denied any links with the attack and distanced himself from the assailants, but said their actions could be pardoned as they were merely “defending their home and people”.","A controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker has sued a district councillor in a Hong Kong court, accusing him of inciting others to vandalise one of his offices. In a writ filed to the District Court on Thursday, Junius Ho Kwan-yiu claimed an unspecified sum from pro-democracy councillor Roy Tam Hoi-pong, who he said conspired with or incited other protesters to trespass and damage his branch office in Tsuen Wan. The damage was intentional, or at least reckless, with the aim of “threatening the personal safety of [Ho] and did cause [him] to feel threatened for his physical and psychological well-being”, the writ read. But it did not include the date on which the incident occurred. Ho, a legislator for the New Territories West constituency and also a rural leader, has been mired in controversy following an indiscriminate attack on anti-government protesters and other passengers by a group of white-clad men at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, which left at least 45 injured. Over 100 protesters gathered outside Ho’s district office in Tsuen Wan on July 22. Some of them broke windows and wrecked surveillance cameras inside the premises. Posting on Facebook after the incident, Ho called for Tam’s arrest, claiming he was one of the masterminds and had incited others to go on the rampage in his office. Tam, who was outside the shopping centre where Ho’s office was situated at the time, told the Post the allegation was “false and unsubstantiated”. “I will definitely not compromise, because I neither went upstairs nor encouraged anybody to vandalise his office that day,” Tam said. The Post has contacted Ho for comment.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3022155/hong-kong-lawmaker-junius-ho-sues-district-councillor
Chinese military official in Hong Kong vows to combat ‘evil separatist forces’ and safeguard city’s prosperity and stability,"Statement comes as unrest over now-abandoned extradition bill gradually transforms into a movement against government and police in Hong Kong; Last Wednesday, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director warned Beijing would not sit by if crisis escalated beyond local government’s control","3:02pm, 9 Aug, 2019","Chen Yading’s remarks on Friday came amid the ongoing unrest in the city sparked by the now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed the handover of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city does not have such an agreement, including mainland China.; On Wednesday, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office weighed in, warning Beijing would not sit by and watch if the crisis escalated beyond the local government’s control.","The deputy political commissar of the Chinese military garrison in Hong Kong has vowed to combat “evil separatist forces” and safeguard the city’s prosperity and stability. “The garrison will continue its tradition to safeguard the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and will be determined to combat evil separatist forces,” Chen said on the sidelines of the army’s annual blood donation drive on Friday morning. He said the People’s Liberation Army’s Hong Kong garrison had been actively taking part in charities to “strengthen the blood-and-flesh connection” with local citizens. Last Wednesday, Chen Daoxiang, the commander of the PLA’s Hong Kong garrison, warned that violent clashes would not be tolerated, adding that the army was determined to protect China’s sovereignty. The garrison also released a promotional video featuring a soldier shouting in Cantonese during an anti-riot drill: “All consequences are at your own risk.” Under Article 14 of the Basic Law – Hong Kong’s mini-constitution – the city can ask the central government for help from the garrison for maintaining public order and disaster relief. Some 390 male and 11 female soldiers donated between 350ml to 400ml of blood in the annual event which took place at the PLA Hospital in Jordan. Senior Colonel Wang Yanshun said he was happy to be part of the drive, as donating blood is a way to help Hong Kong. “For the sake of peace and stability, everyone should spread love,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022128/chinese-military-official-hong-kong-vows-combat-evil
Hong Kong police warn North Point violence will not be tolerated,Close-knit Fujianese community in city passes on message to “mainland brothers” said to be on their way for Sunday protest march; Online posts and video clips calling on Fujian natives to fight Hong Kong demonstrators at North Point this weekend have spread rapidly,"2:00pm, 9 Aug, 2019","Chen Yading’s remarks on Friday came amid the ongoing unrest in the city sparked by the now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed the handover of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city does not have such an agreement, including mainland China.; On Wednesday, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office weighed in, warning Beijing would not sit by and watch if the crisis escalated beyond the local government’s control.","Police are warning Hong Kong’s Fujianese community that anyone engaging in violence will be arrested, regardless of their background. The warning comes after a night of horror early this week when protesters fought a street battle in North Point with attackers armed with long poles and other improvised weapons. Rumours have been flying around the city that some Fujianese associations and clan communities were mobilising relatives and friends from their hometowns on the mainland to come and settle scores following the fierce skirmish in North Point on Monday night. The North Point district on Hong Kong Island has a large, close-knit community from the southern mainland province of Fujian. A member of the Fujianese Nam An (Hong Kong) Association said on Thursday that Hong Kong police had approached the organisation and warned them they would “definitely arrest anyone who is going to fight on the streets in Hong Kong”. “Hong Kong police have urged all Fujianese associations and relevant organisations to stop the mobilisation,” he said, while refusing to be named. “The police want us to tell our folks in Fujian that they would arrest anyone who broke Hong Kong laws – doesn’t matter whether they are on the government side or on the side of the protesters.” He went on to say that the association had conveyed the warning to people in Nanan, a county-level city under the port of Quanzhou, which also administers Jinjiang and Shishi, two other smaller cities in the province with close links to Hong Kong’s Fujianese community. A police source confirmed the warning was given soon after Monday night’s violent clashes. He also said police had stepped up patrols in areas such as Ming Yuen Western Street, where the fight broke out. The Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations issued an open letter on Tuesday to all Fujianese in Hong Kong, urging them to “keep calm and restrained” and “don’t act rashly”. Since Monday night’s violence, WeChat and Weibo groups have been flooded with messages warning that “Fujianese brothers” are coming to Hong Kong to teach the anti-government protesters a lesson. Claims have also been widely circulated on mainland China’s social media platforms that high-speed train and air tickets from Fujian to Hong Kong have been sold out since Wednesday and Sunday. However, at Quanzhou’s high-speed rail station on Friday morning, almost all passengers departing on the train bound for Hong Kong’s West Kowloon Station were holidaymakers and tour groups making their way home to Xiamen, in southeastern Fujian, or to the cities of Chaozhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province, as well as Hong Kong. Fierce online posts and video clips calling on Fujian natives to fight against Hong Kong demonstrators at North Point this weekend – some using vulgar language to taunt protesters – have spread rapidly with no sign of them being blocked or censored by social media operators. But, in contrast to the online frenzy, there has been little sign of public outrage in Quanzhou, or any tangible signs that a mobilisation is under way. While some local people in Jinjiang and Shishi said they had heard rumours of a mobilisation, none had actually seen or knew anyone who was taking part. “There was a rumour that five or six coaches carrying 200 to 300 people left Shuitou [a township in Nanan] for Hong Kong on Tuesday,” a man who runs a small business near the bus station said. “I do business here every day but I haven’t seen any of them.” “I did see the photo of a T-shirt design via WeChat, calling on Fujian people to fight the stupid young people in Hong Kong,” a man running a clothing shop in Shishi said. “But, as far as I know, there is no clothing factory that has actually produced the T-shirts. Here in this wholesale clothing market in Shishi, we have hundreds of stalls but none is selling this T-shirt.” A civil servant in Shishi also said he did not support any violent retaliation. “I am against the call [for revenge],” he said, while declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to overseas media. “Who will be hurt if the conflict actually happens, Fujianese or Hong Kong people? Our media and the government should call on the public to calm down, instead of letting these kinds of rumours, misunderstandings, and hatred spread via social media.” In Hong Kong’s “Little Fujian” area, it was business as usual on Wednesday for shops in Chun Yeung Street, close to Ming Yuen Street where Monday’s violence took place. But some stallholders said they intended to close early on Sunday because of the scheduled demonstration. A stallholder, who gave his surname as Choi, said the community would send their “brothers” to stand on the street during Sunday’s march. “[I’ve heard] those Fujianese who work in construction sites would come here on Sunday. They were on standby on Tuesday night, but the protesters didn’t come,” he said. “Of course, if the protesters just pass by and don’t enter our place, we will just let them go. We just want to tell them that North Point is our territory and the Fujianese have been here for generations. We Fujianese will not allow other people to mess up our place and force us to shut down our business.” A middle-aged woman who runs a grocery shop in Chun Yeung Street said some families were in a dilemma because their own children were among the protesters. “We were torn because some of our children have followed the crowd and joined the protests. We were shocked when we saw their parents were with them in the demonstrations,” the woman said, who declined to give her name. “These parents claimed their children were dragged into the mess by their university classmates. They were in the protests trying to stop their children from joining the fights.” A Baptist University student, who is also Fujianese, denied he had been misled by his classmates into joining the anti-government protests. Instead, he said that “asymmetric information” – from vastly different sources – between the young and older generations was to blame for their different understandings of the situation. The same, he said, was true between mainlanders and the Hong Kong public. “I’ve insisted that our protests should stick to the principles of ‘peace, rational, non-violence and non-profanity’,” he said, while also requesting anonymity. “I oppose the use of violence by some extradition bill protesters, so I also disagree with the Fujianese reacting to violence with violence.” Additional reporting by Laurie Chen and Clifford Lo",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3022093/hong-kong-police-warn-north-point-violence-will-not-be
"Hong Kong police refuse permission for four anti-government marches, organisers call it ‘shocking’ attack on Basic Law rights","Marches in Tai Po, Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po and Hong Kong Island were due to be held over the weekend but approval is denied by police; Police fear not enough done to prevent violent elements joining protests, which organisers deny","12:38pm, 9 Aug, 2019","Chen Yading’s remarks on Friday came amid the ongoing unrest in the city sparked by the now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed the handover of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city does not have such an agreement, including mainland China.; On Wednesday, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office weighed in, warning Beijing would not sit by and watch if the crisis escalated beyond the local government’s control.","Organisers of anti-government marches have accused police of a “shocking” clampdown on peaceful protest in Hong Kong after four applications were turned down. Marches in Tai Po and Wong Tai Sin, both scheduled for Saturday, have been refused permission by the force over fears they could turn violent. A third event was rejected when police barred a march to be held on Sunday from Causeway Bay to North Point, but allowed a rally to be staged in Victoria Park. A fourth protest, proposed in Sham Shui Po, was also banned by police on Friday. In rejecting the applications for the marches, police cited public safety reasons as all four neighbourhood had been scenes of intense clashes between police and protesters. Two of the banned protests will be taken to an appeals board. In a statement, the organisers of the march in Wong Tai Sin said: “According to Article 27 of the Basic Law [the city’s mini-constitution], Hong Kong citizens shall have freedom of assembly, procession and demonstration. “But the police’s repeated attempts recently to ban the application for rallies and marches in different districts are shocking.” They said it was irresponsible for the force to ban their application by attributing responsibility for previous post-march clashes to organisers, allegations they said were unsubstantiated. But the Wong Tai Sin event organisers said they would not lodge an appeal against the police ban due to their lack of confidence in the complaints mechanism, and called on Hongkongers to join other protests to be held in different districts. Before joining an appeal hearing on Friday afternoon, one of the organisers of the Tai Po march, Roy Chan Hoi-hing, said they would propose some alternative plans to address the police’s concerns, including shortening the route and changing the ending points. He added that many Tai Po residents, particularly the elderly, were keen to join the march. “They said it would be fine if they just walked six to seven laps of Tai Po Sports Ground or held a rally there,” Chan said. He said the organising committee intended to cancel the march if the appeal failed and declined to comment on the possibility of a wildcat demonstration being mounted by others. Tse Lai-nam, one of the two applicants seeking police approval for a march in Island East on Sunday, said they were seeking legal advice and would decide whether to appeal against the force's march ban. “Basically all marches would run peacefully if there were no police and Triads,” said Tse, who is also a member of the political party Demosisto. “It's ridiculous that police don’t tackle the gangsters in a community but suppresses the citizens' basic right of assembly.” He was referring to gangsters who had appeared at different protest sites to attack people with wooden, bamboo and metal sticks, including in Yuen Long on July 21 and in North Point on Monday. Protesters have sought to highlight the five main demands of the movement, including a full withdrawal of the now-abandoned bill and an independent investigation into police’s use of force on demonstrators. The extradition bill would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions the city does not have an extradition agreement with, including mainland China.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022103/hong-kong-police-refuse-permission-three-anti-government
Hong Kong airport occupied by hundreds of protesters amid tightened security,"Thousands expected to join peaceful sit-in against the extradition bill, which could last until Sunday; More ID and ticket checks introduced on Friday with a public area closed off to non-travellers","9:36am, 9 Aug, 2019","Since the protest started at 1pm in the airport’s arrival hall, protesters have been distributing leaflets to travellers explaining the main demands of the movement, which erupted from opposition to the now-abandoned extradition bill.; A similar protest held last month at the airport attracted critics including an elderly man who was jostled by protesters after lashing out at a protest sign.","Hundreds of people have joined a mass sit-in at Hong Kong International Airport on Friday in a fresh round of anti-government protests designed to secure international backing for the movement. Organisers were expecting thousands to show up, and hoped police would respect what they said would be a peaceful protest that was initially billed to last until Sunday. Ahead of the demonstration, the airport had increased security that led to passengers experiencing delays in reaching departure gates, as airlines warned travellers to arrive early for their flights. The five demands include a full withdrawal of the draft legislation, implementation of universal suffrage and a retraction of the riot label attached to recent anti-bill protests. One man with posters stuck to his body, written in Japanese and English, was handing out stickers saying “stand with Hong Kong”. “We don’t really have an estimate but we expect thousands to turn up,” said the organiser of the sit-in, who gave his surname as Lee. “We have coordinated with the airport staff and this will be a peaceful rally, so we hope the police can respect that.” Kitty Cheung, 24, who was handing out leaflets to visitors as she took part in the demonstration, said: “I think the international awareness is high already but still the government doesn’t want to listen to our voice or opinion. We will keep telling the government what we want.” A 24-year-old called Mimi was also helping distribute information on the opposition to the extradition bill. “Many countries have raised their awareness but our government has done nothing,” she said. “The international awareness is enough for us to be effective.” Mio Tomoda, a Japanese woman who was in Hong Kong on personal business, said she was impressed by the sit-in. “I have been following the news on the TV and social media, I think it is right that they are fighting back because Hong Kong is not China,” she said. Before the start of Friday’s demonstration, temporary security measures were put in place at HKIA’s departure hall, as the airport prepared for a large-scale demonstration, despite the absence of any formal protest applications. In effect, a new restricted area had been created in a large part of the airport that would normally be open to the public. Passengers were warned to get to the airport early to avoid queues, and to factor in extra travelling time for reaching the terminal. Queues were forming on Friday morning for access to the check-in area as the changes kicked in. Barriers two layers deep had been assembled, with large posters telling the public that only travellers with an air ticket and travel documentation could pass beyond the start of the check-in desks. The Airport Authority, which runs HKIA, said the new measures were “to maintain the smooth process of the departure procedures of passengers and the terminal operation.” Only departing travellers with air tickets or boarding passes for flights in the next 24 hours and a valid travel document, or airport staff with proof of identity, would be allowed to access the check-in aisles at Terminal 1 from 6am to 11.59pm, between August 9 and 11, the authority announced. Security measures would not be strictly enforced, with passengers not yet holding a boarding pass before reaching the new security line able to pass through with proof they were catching a flight that day, according to the Airport Authority. The measures suggested the airport was worried about protests spilling airside. All tables and chairs at the Starbucks cafe in the departure hall had also been removed on Friday morning. Only a handful of travellers expressed resentment at the measures, attempting to barge their way through the security without producing a ticket. The protest follows the cancellation of more than 250 flights as part of the citywide strike on Monday, which had a knock-on effect into Tuesday. On July 26, an estimated 15,000 protesters gathered at the airport to try and win international support for the movement against the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city does not have an extradition agreement. The measures introduced for Friday and this weekend were not in place for last month’s demonstration. Sharon Wong, 17, who was dropping off a friend, said the deployment of extra security could be viewed with a degree of cynicism for casting aspersions on protesters, who had previously held peaceful forms of demonstration at HKIA. Student Joshua Tran, 18, agreed, saying the way they were setting up security was “labelling” the protest “not just sitting in an arrival hall, [but] as something will happen, there will be action”. Police said they had not received any applications for permission to hold the rally, and urged protesters to stay peaceful if they went ahead with what would be an illegal gathering.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3022074/security-increased-hong-kong-international-airport-ahead
"Two months on and nearly 2,000 rounds of tear gas later, what do Hong Kong’s extradition bill protesters really want?","In a new series of in-depth articles on the unrest rocking Hong Kong and its impact and implications, the Post goes behind the headlines to look at the underlying issues, current state of affairs, and where it is all heading; In this first instalment, we analyse what the protesters really want and what the chances are of persuading them to stay off the streets","8:00am, 9 Aug, 2019","When Hong Kong was brought to its knees on Monday, Jay Sin, bespectacled, masked and helmeted, was in high spirits and in a hurry.; What is happening in Hong Kong is indeed a question exercising the minds of many. Friday is exactly two months to the day since the June 9 mass protest when an estimated 1 million people took to the streets to oppose the now-shelved extradition bill. But that first protest – a peaceful one where people wore white to symbolise how they were at a funeral marking the death of Hong Kong – seemed like a more innocent time.; The city has breached uncharted territory again and again. The storming and vandalising of the Legislative Council on July 1 shocked everyone. The appearance of white-shirted men in Yuen Long – some of them suspected triad members – who beat passers-by indiscriminately on July 21 was another shocking turning point, prompting more people to side with protesters.; The defacing of the national emblem at Beijing’s liaison office with black paint stunned many, while last weekend’s spree of violence leading up to Monday’s citywide strike that paralysed the city was another major shock.; But for Sin, it was a day protesters showed the depth of their anger. Sin, who had been taking part in the extradition bill protests from the start, joined a rally in Mong Kok at 1pm. He and hundreds of others then moved en masse to besiege Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, defacing the walls and throwing eggs and bricks, before they were dispersed by tear gas.; These violent provocations continued late into the night in multiple locations, as they started fires at other police stations, engaged officers in a laser beam battle, and hoisted giant slings to lob bricks at police.; That Monday, police used more than 800 rounds of tear gas, compared with 1,000 rounds in the previous two months.; Two months in, almost everyone can agree on at least one thing: Hong Kong is facing its worst political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Political observers and top government insiders see no endgame in sight even as some believe the city is on the precipice of permanent decline if peace does not come soon.; The protesters have a radical core but the broader movement has widespread support across generational and income lines. It started out as a rejection of the controversial extradition bill. But two months on, how has the cause changed?; In February, the government proposed amendments to the Fugitives Offenders Ordinance to allow for ad hoc transfers of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city lacks an agreement. It was to ensure a Hong Kong suspect could be brought to justice over the killing of his girlfriend in Taiwan, and it would also plug a legal loophole with other countries if their citizens who had committed crimes used the city for refuge.; As business chambers one after another voiced their objections to the bill, which they said removed the legal firewall between Hong Kong and mainland China, where fair trials were not guaranteed, other influential institutions like the Catholic Church, the Law Society and the Bar Association all chimed in and the momentum of opposition grew.; Despite the June 9 protest, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor tabled a second reading of the bill for June 12. But Legco could not sit that day as protesters besieged its premises and clashes broke out between demonstrators and police, with tear gas and rubber bullets used.; On June 15, Lam suspended the bill but did not apologise for her government’s bungling. The next day, an estimated 2 million people, according to organisers, marched, blanketing the city with wave upon wave of black, the new colour of protest.; The seemingly leaderless protest movement voted at first on several demands on their secret social media channels. Even though at first they wanted Lam to resign, they put this aside, deeming it irrelevant – as it would make no difference if the system persisted – and settled on five items: fully withdraw the extradition bill, order an independent inquiry into the clashes between protesters and police, retract the “riot” classification of the clashes of June 12, drop the charges against all arrested demonstrators and relaunch the stalled electoral reform process.; Lam has refused all five demands. Instead of saying the bill was withdrawn, she declared it to be “dead”, insisting it held greater finality than “withdrawn” as the latter meant a piece of legislation could be reintroduced.; On the call to have the riot charges dropped, Lam said the terminology had no effect on the actual legal case brought to bear on those arrested on June 12. At the time, none of the 64 people arrested had been charged, even though others detained more recently have been served court papers.; On the demand for amnesty, opposition supporters like former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang have called for a one-off exercise to all involved in the June 12 clashes. Again, the government has refused, arguing it would weaken the rule of law if investigations and prosecutions were not followed through.; Of the protesters’ five demands, the one that has won the widest support has been the call for a commission of inquiry to investigate police actions. Several observers – including eight former political appointees – have said an inquiry to cover the actions of both protesters and police might even be palatable. Lam has insisted that the Independent Police Complaints Council would do just as good a job.; After last weekend’s mayhem and the start of Monday’s citywide strike, Lam took a tougher stance, reframing the protests as an attack on national sovereignty and the “one country, two systems” principle under which Hong Kong is promised freedoms not allowed in the rest of China.; Her evidence: the protesters’ slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, and their act of throwing the Chinese national flag into Victoria Harbour.; “Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city’s future?” Lam asked. “Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said was to bring collateral damage, will push Hong Kong onto a path of no return.”; The profile of protesters also showed many are young and well educated. More than 60 per cent of participants at various marches and protests since June 9 polled had tertiary education or above.; Asked which of eight slogans could represent the movement since June, 92.6 per cent in Tseung Kwan O and Western district chose “No rioters, only tyranny”, compared with 68.5 per cent who chose “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, the slogan that surfaced in the past two weeks or so.; The slogan was used by pro-independence activist Edward Leung Tin-kei when he ran for the legislature in a 2016 by-election. Leung, now serving a six-year jail term over his role in the 2016 Mong Kok riot, said then he was representing an era of people willing to spend “blood and sweat” to fight for their freedoms.; A government source said that, no matter how wide the scope, police would unavoidably be targeted in the inquiry.; Other parts of this series have examined why Hong Kong protesters view the police as the enemy, how leaders have spurned the chance to listen to public opinion and why does Beijing keep getting Hong Kong wrong?","He had to be in many places. “We’re trying to make it more difficult for police to plan their operations,” Sin said when the Post met him at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom. By then, he and his fellow protesters had walked more than 4km from Mong Kok in the summer heat, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. On the tunnel billboard above him, his comrades had already spray-painted the catchphrase “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”. If this was a revolution, Sin was the archetypal freedom fighter. Reed-thin, dressed in Bermudas and a black T-shirt, and geared up to hide his identity, he was polite when explaining their actions. Before rushing off to his next target, the 22-year-old said: “We understand we’re creating lots of trouble for the public. There is a cost incurred by a social movement. “We hope what we are doing will draw people’s attention to what is happening in Hong Kong.” Since then, there have been nine consecutive weeks of demonstrations, nearly all resulting in clashes with police. By now trained to defuse the canisters as they land – by snuffing them with a traffic cone or a metal dish – they gathered their supplies and ran off. They then made their way to the Hung Hom tunnel. Quickly, they assembled a barrier of metal fences and emptied water barricades to block the tunnel entrance. Twenty minutes later, they fled, location unknown. What exactly is this movement that has taken hold of Hong Kong society such that police are seen as the biggest enemy, more and more people have become inured to violence and the fabled can-do spirit of Hongkongers seems to be morphing into a collective let’s-see-what-happens-next attitude? This demand is now mired in the morass of semantics as critics accuse her of stubborn pride. Yet hours after Lam spoke, the violence escalated and while people might have been shocked by it all, surveys showed more protesters had come around to the need for such action. Polls by a research team from Chinese, Baptist and Lingnan universities on the marchers found growing acceptance of violent means. Among 875 respondents who took part in the June 16 march, 69 per cent agreed it was understandable for protesters to resort to force if the government was ignoring their demands. This was the weekend after the violent clashes of June 12. The proportion surged to 94.7 per cent of 680 polled in the July 21 march, and 96 per cent of the 717 polled at the Tseung Kwan O march on Sunday. Three in five, or 59 per cent of the more than 1,200 polled at the Tseung Kwan O and Western district protests on Sunday were aged under 29. More than three-quarters in this age group had tertiary education or above. Lingnan University political scientist Samson Yuen Wai-hei, one of the academics behind the polls, said the findings debunked the perception that many protesters were poorly educated or lacked good jobs. Yuen however said this slogan was “actually not so popular among protesters”, adding: “It is not widely accepted as the main objective of the ongoing protests.” But Beijing loyalist Ip Kwok-him read it as a separatist slogan aimed at overthrowing the central and local governments. Interviews with protesters who do not take part in the violence, however, did bear this out. Many still believed the government ought to meet them halfway, and brushed aside Lam’s stern redefining of the fight as one over sovereignty. Even if her words contained the threat that the central government could order a crackdown, they were unfazed. Most whom the Post spoke to on Monday had a common wish among their demands: an independent inquiry into recent clashes between protesters and police. Housewife Cherry Mok, 40, who was with her teenage son at the rally in Mong Kok on Monday, insisted protesters were still calling for the five demands to be met and, for her, the most important was to have an independent inquiry. “It can help cool down the crisis by unearthing the truth. It can probe both police and protesters,” she said. “People can then seek some comfort to address their emotions.” Matthew Chung, a 29-year-old who runs a music company, felt the movement was no longer focused on the bill but on police’s handling of the protests. “The first thing to be done should be the launch of an independent inquiry [into police actions]. This is the bottom line,” he said. “We just want justice.” The businessman said he and other protesters shouted “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” because they wanted to revive the city’s spirit and call for freedom and democracy, not to seek independence. Thus the claim that they were trying to launch a revolution was false, he said. A poll from July 24 to July 26 by opinion survey agency Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found that nearly 80 per cent of 1,007 respondents supported a commission of inquiry and 73 per cent backed a full withdrawal of the bill. Pro-establishment lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun’s own encounters with protesters convinced him this was the right way out of the impasse. On Monday, at about 3pm, when hundreds were besieging the Tsuen Wan police district headquarters, Tien, a district councillor of the area, rushed to the scene. He tried speaking to them but they ignored him and so he chatted with the demonstrators looking on and chanting slogans in support of the radical bunch. Tien claimed the protesters told him they would stop taking part in further demonstrations if the government launched an independent inquiry and formally withdrew the extradition bill. “They believed half of the peaceful protesters would no longer take to the streets if these two demands were met,” he said. On these demonstrators’ empathy for the radicals in the front line, he said: “It’s a kind of delicate connection between the radical minority and peaceful majority.” The demonstrators have been keeping faith in a key slogan of the marches since June 9 – “bat got zek”. It means: To stay united and not cut ties with people whose aspirations you disagree with. For Tien, things also got personal that day. A black-clad man in his 20s patted him on the shoulder near the MTR station. “He told me he was a sales executive of my company and took leave to join the rally and besiege the police station,” said Tien, who is chairman of clothing chain G2000. The lawmaker realised then how widespread support was for the anti-government protests, including among his own employees. “The government needs to respond to the reasonable demands of peaceful demonstrators,” he said. For Tien, one reasonable response is to have an independent judge-led commission of inquiry. The list of those advocating this commission is growing. They range from former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang and Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman – and ardent Lam supporter – Allan Zeman to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, the city’s biggest business chamber. But Lam has insisted the matter should be left to the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), the police watchdog. It has had a special panel looking into the clashes since June. Cheung Chor-yung, a senior teaching fellow of public policy at City University, said all sectors, including government employees, should join forces to urge Lam to set up a commission of inquiry while calling for an end to violence by all sides. “The commission could have a more general set of terms of reference to avoid targeting police, and be given another task, to facilitate reconciliation,” he said. Former Bar Association chairman Paul Shieh Wing-tai, who has been involved in four independent inquiries, said a judge-led commission could help bring some closure by allowing all sides to air their grievances. “You have to assume some reasonableness on the part of the general public, who, if they see a sensible demand is not acceded to, their sympathy or grievance may not go away,” Shieh said. “But if a reasonable demand is acceded to, and one continues to press for not-so-reasonable demands, the sympathy will dry up.” The government was being ineffectual in merely condemning the violence committed or asking the public to calm down, without getting to the root causes of the grievances, he said. “Some say the kids are disillusioned by the way ‘one country, two systems’ has been working. Some say no, these are ‘rubbish youth’ who cannot afford to buy a flat, they have no jobs, and they are jealous of China, therefore they stage riots,” Shieh said. The government has been reluctant to have an independent inquiry, according to multiple inside sources, because it does not want to affect police morale. But Shieh said this was precisely the reason to hold one, to avoid further harm to police. Another senior counsel, who has represented the government before, also said the commission’s inquiry could prompt a review into offences such as rioting. The veteran lawyer, who requested anonymity as he feared potential conflict, said the judicial setting of the inquiry would give the greatest benefit of openness to examine any claim, including that of foreign intervention. “Every party will know it will be broadcast to the public, and ... we will also try to conduct it in a way easily understood by the layman,” he said. “The inquiry could help contain the political conflict and redirect focus back towards improving the system.” But Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University, said an independent probe would not solve the crisis if Lam stayed in office. “People no longer trust that Lam will appoint someone who would independently and impartially investigate the matter and subsequently hold the relevant police officers accountable,” he said. As tensions between police and protesters escalate in recent weeks, pro-independence activist Edward Leung, author of the slogan “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” made an emotional appeal from behind bars. In a letter published on his Facebook page on July 29 and which attracted 49,000 likes, Leung said he was pained by the bloody scenes of the recent protests. “But I hope you can understand that with your love for Hong Kong, you all have already demonstrated your unparalleled courage and rewritten the city’s history,” he wrote. It was important “not to be dominated by hatred – one should always stay vigilant and keep thinking when in peril”, he said. Similarly, in the aftermath of Monday’s madness, pan-democratic figures like lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung urged protesters to refrain from violence. “Violent acts like besieging police stations and starting fires outside the quarters of disciplined services staff can’t help win public support,” he said. Lingnan University academic Samson Yuen said while the government appeared to be adopting the strategy of attrition to wear out protesters like during the Occupy protests in 2014, it was also “now deploying a higher intensity of repression to handle radical protesters”. “The harm inflicted on society and the resultant divisions are more serious than what happened five years ago,” he warned. Yuen also said many protesters were adaptable and cared about public opinion. Hence, after Monday’s events, there were posts on popular local online forum LIHKG urging them to become peaceful. He said the protests might gradually fade out in September with the new school year, because university and senior secondary school students formed the backbone of frontline protesters. “The arrests of hundreds of protesters has also unavoidably dealt a blow to the anti-government protests,” he said. But Cheung Chor-yung said protesters recently resorted to guerilla warfare, wandering around different areas to cause trouble for police and avoiding arrest. And even if public opinion soured on the radicals, he doubted that it meant Lam could gain back support. As tensions escalate, Beijing has eyed the movement with concern but thrown its support fully behind Lam. All talk about the deployment of the People’s Liberation Army, which maintains a garrison in the city, is nuanced but clear in that deploying soldiers is not by any means imminent. Right now, though, Beijing is keen to get the pro-establishment camp to rally to bring about a semblance of peace. At a meeting with 500 loyalists in Shenzhen on Wednesday, the key official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Zhang Xiaoming, said ending the chaos and violence was a key priority. But Beijing would not sit and watch if things deteriorated further, according to Zhang. “According to the Basic Law, the central authorities have ample methods as well as sufficient strength to promptly settle any possible turmoil should it occur,” he said. At the same time, he did not rule out a commission of inquiry, once peace was restored. For now, Beijing has cast the deep-seated problem as one about economic opportunity, with Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, saying this week the government needed to solve issues such as young people’s mobility, and career and housing prospects. But the poll by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute last month found only 58 per cent of respondents aged 14 to 29 felt their discontent stemmed from housing problems, compared with 84 per cent attributing it to their distrust of the chief executive. Another 87 per cent opted for the “pursuit of democracy”. Andrew Fung Ho-keung, chief executive of think tank the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, warned that the government had a mountain to climb in governance as it had lost the hearts and minds of a huge swathe of young people. “Hong Kong people hope the government will show its leadership to defuse the tension but it has failed to come up with feasible solutions, apart from condemning protesters’ radical actions. We can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. On Monday, protesters like Angus Chow, a 26-year construction consultant, echoed the sentiment when he joined others to surround the government office in Mong Kok. “Today, the government forced us to do this. It’s been nearly two months ... If they still refuse to listen to the public, the crisis will continue to escalate.” Like the young Jay Sin, he was in a hurry to get to the next protest site. And the one after.

US calls Beijing a ‘thuggish regime’ for ‘harassing’ American diplomat over Hong Kong meeting with Joshua Wong,"State Department accuses Chinese government of ‘leaking’ official’s personal details, including photograph and names of children; China has demanded that US diplomats ‘stop interfering’ in city’s affairs after reported meeting with local democracy activists","5:59am, 9 Aug, 2019","When Hong Kong was brought to its knees on Monday, Jay Sin, bespectacled, masked and helmeted, was in high spirits and in a hurry.; What is happening in Hong Kong is indeed a question exercising the minds of many. Friday is exactly two months to the day since the June 9 mass protest when an estimated 1 million people took to the streets to oppose the now-shelved extradition bill. But that first protest – a peaceful one where people wore white to symbolise how they were at a funeral marking the death of Hong Kong – seemed like a more innocent time.; The city has breached uncharted territory again and again. The storming and vandalising of the Legislative Council on July 1 shocked everyone. The appearance of white-shirted men in Yuen Long – some of them suspected triad members – who beat passers-by indiscriminately on July 21 was another shocking turning point, prompting more people to side with protesters.; The defacing of the national emblem at Beijing’s liaison office with black paint stunned many, while last weekend’s spree of violence leading up to Monday’s citywide strike that paralysed the city was another major shock.; But for Sin, it was a day protesters showed the depth of their anger. Sin, who had been taking part in the extradition bill protests from the start, joined a rally in Mong Kok at 1pm. He and hundreds of others then moved en masse to besiege Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, defacing the walls and throwing eggs and bricks, before they were dispersed by tear gas.; These violent provocations continued late into the night in multiple locations, as they started fires at other police stations, engaged officers in a laser beam battle, and hoisted giant slings to lob bricks at police.; That Monday, police used more than 800 rounds of tear gas, compared with 1,000 rounds in the previous two months.; Two months in, almost everyone can agree on at least one thing: Hong Kong is facing its worst political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Political observers and top government insiders see no endgame in sight even as some believe the city is on the precipice of permanent decline if peace does not come soon.; The protesters have a radical core but the broader movement has widespread support across generational and income lines. It started out as a rejection of the controversial extradition bill. But two months on, how has the cause changed?; In February, the government proposed amendments to the Fugitives Offenders Ordinance to allow for ad hoc transfers of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city lacks an agreement. It was to ensure a Hong Kong suspect could be brought to justice over the killing of his girlfriend in Taiwan, and it would also plug a legal loophole with other countries if their citizens who had committed crimes used the city for refuge.; As business chambers one after another voiced their objections to the bill, which they said removed the legal firewall between Hong Kong and mainland China, where fair trials were not guaranteed, other influential institutions like the Catholic Church, the Law Society and the Bar Association all chimed in and the momentum of opposition grew.; Despite the June 9 protest, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor tabled a second reading of the bill for June 12. But Legco could not sit that day as protesters besieged its premises and clashes broke out between demonstrators and police, with tear gas and rubber bullets used.; On June 15, Lam suspended the bill but did not apologise for her government’s bungling. The next day, an estimated 2 million people, according to organisers, marched, blanketing the city with wave upon wave of black, the new colour of protest.; The seemingly leaderless protest movement voted at first on several demands on their secret social media channels. Even though at first they wanted Lam to resign, they put this aside, deeming it irrelevant – as it would make no difference if the system persisted – and settled on five items: fully withdraw the extradition bill, order an independent inquiry into the clashes between protesters and police, retract the “riot” classification of the clashes of June 12, drop the charges against all arrested demonstrators and relaunch the stalled electoral reform process.; Lam has refused all five demands. Instead of saying the bill was withdrawn, she declared it to be “dead”, insisting it held greater finality than “withdrawn” as the latter meant a piece of legislation could be reintroduced.; On the call to have the riot charges dropped, Lam said the terminology had no effect on the actual legal case brought to bear on those arrested on June 12. At the time, none of the 64 people arrested had been charged, even though others detained more recently have been served court papers.; On the demand for amnesty, opposition supporters like former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang have called for a one-off exercise to all involved in the June 12 clashes. Again, the government has refused, arguing it would weaken the rule of law if investigations and prosecutions were not followed through.; Of the protesters’ five demands, the one that has won the widest support has been the call for a commission of inquiry to investigate police actions. Several observers – including eight former political appointees – have said an inquiry to cover the actions of both protesters and police might even be palatable. Lam has insisted that the Independent Police Complaints Council would do just as good a job.; After last weekend’s mayhem and the start of Monday’s citywide strike, Lam took a tougher stance, reframing the protests as an attack on national sovereignty and the “one country, two systems” principle under which Hong Kong is promised freedoms not allowed in the rest of China.; Her evidence: the protesters’ slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, and their act of throwing the Chinese national flag into Victoria Harbour.; “Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city’s future?” Lam asked. “Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said was to bring collateral damage, will push Hong Kong onto a path of no return.”; The profile of protesters also showed many are young and well educated. More than 60 per cent of participants at various marches and protests since June 9 polled had tertiary education or above.; Asked which of eight slogans could represent the movement since June, 92.6 per cent in Tseung Kwan O and Western district chose “No rioters, only tyranny”, compared with 68.5 per cent who chose “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, the slogan that surfaced in the past two weeks or so.; The slogan was used by pro-independence activist Edward Leung Tin-kei when he ran for the legislature in a 2016 by-election. Leung, now serving a six-year jail term over his role in the 2016 Mong Kok riot, said then he was representing an era of people willing to spend “blood and sweat” to fight for their freedoms.; A government source said that, no matter how wide the scope, police would unavoidably be targeted in the inquiry.; Other parts of this series have examined why Hong Kong protesters view the police as the enemy, how leaders have spurned the chance to listen to public opinion and why does Beijing keep getting Hong Kong wrong?","The United States on Thursday accused the Chinese government of being behind the leak of a Hong Kong-based US diplomat’s personal information, after a pro-Beijing newspaper disclosed details of the official’s personal life. “I don’t think that leaking an American diplomat’s private information, pictures, names of their children, I don’t think that is a formal protest, that is what a thuggish regime would do,” US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said at a news briefing in Washington. Her remarks came after the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong lodged a formal complaint with the US consulate general over a meeting between US diplomat Julie Eadeh and pro-democracy activists in the city. After the meeting, Hong Kong’s Ta Kung Pao newspaper published an article disclosing personal details about her, including the names of her children. Leaking such information was “not how a responsible nation would behave,” said Ortagus, who later confirmed that it was the US government’s position that the Chinese government was directly behind the leak. Attending the meeting with Eadeh, who is the political unit chief for the US consulate, were Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and other members of the local political party Demosisto. Expressing its disapproval of the meeting, the commissioner’s office urged the US “to immediately make a clean break from anti-China forces who stir up trouble in Hong Kong, stop sending out wrong signals to violent offenders, refrain from meddling with Hong Kong affairs and avoid going further down the wrong path.” On Thursday, Ortagus objected “to the Chinese saying they issued a formal protest when in fact they harassed an American diplomat”. Ortagus said meetings between diplomats and local political figures were the established protocol of the US foreign service. “American diplomats meet with formal government officials, we meet with opposition protesters, not just in Hong Kong or China,” she said. “This literally happens in every single country in which an American embassy is present.” The diplomat in question was “doing her job and we commend her for her work”, Ortagus added. As protests over a now-suspended proposal to amend Hong Kong’s extradition laws have progressed, the Chinese government has increasingly turned to accusations of interference by foreign powers, even at one point calling violent unrest in the city “the work of the US”. Responding to Eadeh’s meeting with pro-democracy activists, China’s No 2 diplomat in Pakistan tweeted: “Embarrassing! The black hand was caught red-handed!” Attached to Zhao Lijian’s Thursday tweet was a screengrab of Ta Kung Pao’s story. The State Department has rejected all accusations of interference, while US President Donald Trump has sought to distance his administration from the situation, saying last week that it was a matter for Hong Kong and China to resolve “because Hong Kong is a part of China.” Trump has also called the protests “riots”, a term that resonated more closely with the rhetoric of Beijing than the language of other members of his administration. Earlier this week, the State Department said the US government remained “staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022068/us-calls-china-thuggish-regime-singling-out-us-diplomat

Kurt Tong, who retired from the post on July 5 and is now a partner at Washington-based risk consultancy The Asia Group, urged restraint from politicians calling for reviews of a US law that treats the territory as separate from mainland China and from demonstrators making demands on the city’s leaders. Speaking in an interview in Washington, Tong warned the US government against drawing “red lines” that would trigger changes to the separate status Hong Kong enjoys in trade, economic policy and other areas. The Hong Kong Policy Act has given the city special status since 1992, but also allows the US president to revoke it should reviews determine that Hong Kong’s autonomy has been eroded. “I always hesitate to associate any particular red lines or recommending any particular red lines for the US government or for people’s general understanding of what the triggers might be that would lead the US to change the Hong Kong Policy Act either in whole or in part,” Tong said. “It's better to have judgment calls,” he said, adding that the act is “a voluntary framework” that Washington can use fully or partially “in terms of the different elements of US law that treats Hong Kong separately from the rest of China.” “So I don’t think there should be a red line,” Tong said, “but I do think the threshold should be high for the US to make any changes” under the act. US lawmakers including Senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Ben Cardin, a Democrat, introduced legislation in June requiring the US secretary of state to issue an annual certification of Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China for the city to continue enjoying its special status. Tong said passage of Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would make more sense than defining specific conditions under which the Hong Kong Policy Act would be altered, and send a clear diplomatic message to the governments of Hong Kong and Beijing. “The applications are less severe than an actual change to the Hong Kong Policy Act or a change in the implementation of the Hong Kong policy,” the veteran diplomat explained, adding that “it's hard to imagine a situation where that report would say anything other than what it said earlier this year, which is that Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy but it's headed in the wrong direction.” The annual State Department report issued as a provision of the policy act said in its most recent edition, on March 21, that “Hong Kong maintains a sufficient — although diminished — degree of autonomy under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework to justify continued special treatment by the United States for bilateral agreements and programs per the Act”. Turning to the escalating demonstrations in Hong Kong, sparked by its government’s attempt to enact a law that would allow extraditions to the mainland, Tong said of the unrest: “It should stop.” He joins others in calling for protesters to let the dust in Hong Kong settle while at the same time supporting the overall cause: deep concern about Beijing’s approach to handling the city’s affairs. “I continue to think that the powerful messages of the protest movement in Hong Kong were most effective … when it’s peaceful,” Tong said. “It shows strong support from the Hong Kong general public, not a small group of people who have become interested in exploring the boundaries of legal activity or crossing the boundaries of legal activity in expressing their political views.” On Thursday, a group comprising four Christian organisations, including the Justice and Peace Commission of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese, sang hymns and carried electronic candles as it marched through Hong Kong’s busy shopping district of Central and past the bars of Lan Kwai Fong to rally at the Court of Final Appeal. Legislators including NeoDemocrat lawmaker Gary Fan Kwok-wai have also called on the anti-extradition movement’s more radical protesters to rethink their strategy or risk playing into Beijing’s hands. “The protesters’ attempts to besiege police stations or confront officers will definitely weaken the movement and even fall into the government’s trap,” Fan said on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Journalists Association issued a statement on Wednesday condemning protesters who blocked and destroyed a news vehicle from the city’s largest television broadcaster. Tong echoed the sentiment that some demonstrators’ actions have been counterproductive. “The protesters have gotten good at it, at innovative, forceful crossing-the-boundary-of-legality protests,” he said. “But being good at it is not the same thing as it being a good idea.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022064/ex-envoy-kurt-tong-says-threshold-should-be-high-us

They also urged the government to heed protesters’ key demands. Singing hymns and holding electronic candles, the religious group from four Christian organisations, including the Justice and Peace Commission of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese, marched through the busy shopping district of Central and past the bars of Lan Kwai Fong to rally at the Court of Final Appeal. Organisers said 1,200 people joined the march. “In the last two months, the city has been in turmoil. We should have a cooling-off period and a ceasefire of at least two or three months, for both sides to sit down and come to an agreement to move society forward,” Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Ha Chi-shing told the rally. Hong Kong has been gripped by months of street protests centring on opposition to the now-abandoned extradition bill, which would have allowed transfers of criminal suspects to jurisdictions the city has no formal arrangement with. Ha echoed protesters’ central demands, for the bill’s full withdrawal and an inquiry into police’s handling of the unrest. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has already dug in and resisted those demands, insisting “the bill is dead” and any complaints against the force are best handled through established bodies like the Independent Police Complaints Council. The church has been among the bill’s opponents for months. Ha led a continuous prayer meeting with hundreds of followers outside the Legislative Council building after the historic June 16 march which drew an estimated 2 million people. On June 19, a day after the city leader made her first public apology in person over her handling of the bill, Cardinal John Tong Hon, the apostolic administrator of Hong Kong, issued a joint statement with Dr Eric So Shing-yit, chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Council, also calling for the withdrawal and the inquiry. Leading prayers at the rally, Ha said he was worried by the increasingly violent clashes between protesters and the police. He urged restraint on both sides. “We pray for you, law enforcement officers, because we are one family of Hongkongers. I hope you can still maintain your professionalism under enormous stresses and strains of your work,” he said. He also appealed to protesters to stay peaceful, arguing “violence will only breed more violence, and hatred will only create more hatred”. Construction worker Roman So Lok-man, 29, joined the march after work. He said he believed religion could reach across the political divide and heal the rifts in the city. “There are Catholics in both pro-government and anti-bill camp. This peaceful, non-violent march can bridge the divide, and may bring more from the Catholic community into the political discourse,” he said. “A core part of my Catholic faith is fighting for social justice and speaking up for the truth. As a Christian, I feel compelled to make a stand to create a better Hong Kong.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022051/catholics-march-call-cooling-period-amid-hong-kongs

More than two months of civil unrest and anti-government protests across the city have coincided with the drop over the past few weeks, and one leading tourism figure said he thought it could be worse for the industry than the 2003 Sars outbreak. On Thursday, commerce secretary Edward Yau Tang-wah said that the drop in tourist arrivals had accelerated from the 1.5 per cent year-on-year decrease in mid-July to 26 per cent by the end of the month. “For early August, the drop was 31 per cent,” Yau said, also noting the “double digit” percentage drop in hotel occupancy rates in July — especially for hotels on the Hong Kong Island side, where some of the worst clashes between police and protesters had taken place. “The sector contributes to some 4.5 per cent of our GDP, hiring about 250,000 people, or 7 per cent of Hong Kong’s working population. We can’t take it lightly,” Yau said. The drop reversed the trend for the first half of the year; the city recorded visitor arrivals of 5.14 million in June, up 8.5 per cent from the same period a year ago, pushing up total arrivals in the first half of the year to 34.87 million. Hotel occupancy rates saw a nominal one percentage point year-on-year drop in the first six months of the year. Yau also noted that 22 countries and regions had issued travel advisories for Hong Kong, and conceded there was not much the government could do about that. “The government will try to present the factual picture to overseas countries,” he said. “But the best solution is for the violence to go away, and for daily life to resume as normal.” Tourism sector lawmaker Yiu Si-wing said the escalation of travel advisories from the United States and Australia could make the situation worse, as it signalled that Hong Kong was getting deeper in trouble. He said the tourism industry had been hit since June, and expected the number of visitors coming to the city this month to drop by more than 10 per cent when compared to the same period last year. Yiu estimated that the occupancy rate of local hotels in August would also decrease by 20 to 30 per cent, and that their revenue would drop by 40 per cent from the same month last year. “The sector will be entering a chilly winter in the second half of the year if peace could not be restored soon,” Yiu said. Citing industry members’ feedback, Travel Industry Council chairman Jason Wong Chun-tat said that from July, 30 to 50 per cent inbound tour bookings from short-haul markets had been cancelled. “This is just about booking cancellation and we can’t see new bookings. So we believe the situation for the second half of this year will worsen,” he said. Wong estimated the number of tours coming to Hong Kong from some long-haul markets would decline more than 30 per cent from August, compared with the same period in 2018. In the first week of this month, the figure for mainland inbound tours also fell more than 40 per cent year-on-year, he added. “The industry finds the figures shocking and we even feel it’s worse than Sars,” he said, referring to the fatal 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the city. “We are worried about the employment situation in the travel industry. Due to fewer visitors coming to Hong Kong, the income of companies will be slashed, even some staff will have to take non-paid leave.” Meanwhile, the global medical and travel security services firm International SOS said its had received an increasing number of politically related enquiries from various businesses, including banking, finance and insurance companies based in Asia, Europe and the US. Specific questions sought information on planned protest locations, whether the political situation in Hong Kong was improving or worsening, and if specific areas could still be visited during demonstrations, according to the firm. However, a spokesman said the firm had advised that travel to and within Hong Kong should not be a major concern at the moment. “The key advice is that staff, operations and travellers should remain actively aware of the latest situation and outlook, ensure all demonstration activity is avoided, and to build flexibility in plans,” the spokesman said. In a statement on Wednesday, the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong expressed “its serious concern on the political impasses over unresolved issues” and said it would continue to monitor the situation. “The business climate in Hong Kong appears to be inevitably affected and the chamber, whilst firmly condemning the recent violence, hopes that a peaceful solution is found, in the interest of everyone, as soon as possible,” the statement read.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3022049/hong-kongs-summer-discontent-could-lead-chilly

The lacklustre results came with the rail giant expecting more challenges ahead amid the heightened social unrest over the government’s controversial extradition bill, which has prompted protesters to cause serious disruptions to rail services over the past two months. The rail operator, controlled by the government with 75 per cent shareholding, had already issued a profit warning as it made provisions of HK$2 billion for the scandal-hit Sha Tin-Central rail link for its reinforcement works and related expenses. The total cost of the city’s most expensive project will spiral to a record of at least HK$99.1 billion (US$12.6 billion). However, MTR Corp’s CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui said on Thursday that excluding the HK$2 billion, and another provision of HK$430 million for South Western Railway, a joint venture in Britain, the company’s underlying profit would have increased by 26 per cent as revenue grew 7 per cent to HK$28 billion. He said the growth was mainly because of higher contributions from commercial and property rental and management business at the local railway stations. “During the remainder of 2019, we must also contend with a variety of risks, including uncertainties surrounding the worldwide and local economy, particularly trade conflicts, the possibility of an economic recession and political risks,” he said at a press conference announcing the company’s half-yearly results. Kam also admitted the ongoing protests, especially the non-cooperative movement by protesters to disrupt the rail service, would inevitably have an impact on the MTR’s business as the challenges were unprecedented. “As for the protesters’ action in our railways, we are facing a lot of challenges,” he said. “Our vision is to provide safe, reliable and smooth service for our customers. But the pressure and the challenges we face now are tremendous. “The recent situation has nevertheless affected people’s desire to go out or to consume so we can actually see an impact in various parts of Hong Kong.” The rail firm earlier said the beleaguered Sha Tin-Central rail link would partially open from Tai Wai to Kai Tak in the first quarter of next year. Kam said they would reveal the final cost of the rail link at the end of this year, adding it was too early to say who would eventually bear the extra HK$2 billion cost, as they were still following up the contracts from the involved contractors. However, Michael Wu, senior equity analyst in investment research company Morningstar, upgraded the stock to “hold” on August 1, but warned if the protests persisted, there might be a wider impact on the rail operator’s revenue from reduced patronage. “It’s difficult to assess what the underlying impact of the rest of the protests were. I think the impact from the earlier, peaceful protests would have got the population out and about,” he said. “If this was to persist, I think there would be a wider impact on the Airport Express line, which is more sensitive to tourist arrivals. Reduced patronage on the network would also result in lower station revenue, which consists of rental and sales from the kiosk and advertising revenue.” Jonas Kan, director of equity research, Daiwa Institute of Research, rated the MTR a “buy”, and said its commercial income was not directly related to the protests, but railway earnings would be affected to the extent of reduction in passenger numbers. The MTR board also announced an interim dividend of HK$0.25 per share. Its shares closed 0.4 per cent higher on Thursday at HK$48.75 before the results were revealed.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3022038/mtr-corps-management-failings-see-it-take-26-cent-beating

Beijing’s call for unity also prompted a league of major property developers to jointly condemn the increasingly violent protests against the now-shelved extradition bill. On Wednesday, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, denounced the Hong Kong protests as bearing the “obvious characteristics of a colour revolution” and urged some 500 political and business leaders who met him in Shenzhen, mainland China, to fearlessly safeguard the city’s rule of law. Zhang left open the possibility of the government setting up a commission to investigate the recent unrest, something widely called for, but only when the protests have ended. However, a group of activists who have taken part in the spate of protests made clear they would not halt the protests before their demands are met. “The government should first respond to our five demands instead of asking us to stop protesting,” David Chan told a press conference organised by protesters online, rather than any leadership group. “We won’t accept any negotiation or compromise because we have no trust in the government.” The five demands included the inquiry, the bill’s complete withdrawal, the exoneration of arrested protesters, an end to calling the protests “riots”, and universal suffrage. Meanwhile, 16 major developers, all members of the Hong Kong Real Estate Developers Association (REDA), released a statement strongly condemning the escalating protests. They included the biggest players, such as Sun Hung Kai Properties, CK Asset Holdings, Henderson Land Development, New World Development, Sino Land and Swire Properties. Notably absent from the list was Chinese Estate, which is controlled by fugitive tycoon Joseph Lau Luen-hung, who earlier sought a legal challenge against the bill, but eventually dropped it. Tam Yiu-chung, the city’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislative body, said that while Zhang left open the possibility of a commission of inquiry (COI), he also told all at the meeting to have faith in the “widely representative” Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). “Zhang said the crisis has been escalating and flooded with diverse opinions, so the conditions for conducting the investigation are not available,” Tam said. “[He said] the issue of accountability can only be looked into after the saga is over.” Tam added that Zhang said those calling for a COI wanted to weaken the police. “I believe we could look into the possibilities after the saga is over,” Tam said. Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai viewed Zhang’s idea of an “open door” as a delaying tactic. “If the government fails to set up a COI now, it has no motivation to do so after the protests are over,” Wu said. Citing a survey by veteran pollster Robert Chung, which found that about 80 per cent of respondents said a COI should be established, Wu said it was the only way for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to regain authority and continue to govern. However, two executive councillors, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Ip Kwok-him, both voiced reservations about a COI, even after the protests end. “I don’t think anyone would close the door when turmoil comes to a close,” Regina Ip said. “But a judge-led COI may not be the best way forward as a judge can’t collect much evidence and it would be difficult to summon protesters.” She said the review could be done in a new format with dialogue between different sides. Ip Kwok-him said any review should focus on how to solve the city’s deep-rooted conflicts, rather than just looking at police conduct.

It was to ensure a Hong Kong suspect could be brought to justice over the killing of his girlfriend in Taiwan, and it would also plug a legal loophole with other countries if their citizens who had committed crimes used the city for refuge.; As business chambers one after another voiced their objections to the bill, which they said removed the legal firewall between Hong Kong and mainland China, where fair trials were not guaranteed, other influential institutions like the Catholic Church, the Law Society and the Bar Association all chimed in and the momentum of opposition grew.; Despite the June 9 protest, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor tabled a second reading of the bill for June 12. But Legco could not sit that day as protesters besieged its premises and clashes broke out between demonstrators and police, with tear gas and rubber bullets used.; On June 15, Lam suspended the bill but did not apologise for her government’s bungling. The next day, an estimated 2 million people, according to organisers, marched, blanketing the city with wave upon wave of black, the new colour of protest.; The seemingly leaderless protest movement voted at first on several demands on their secret social media channels. Even though at first they wanted Lam to resign, they put this aside, deeming it irrelevant – as it would make no difference if the system persisted – and settled on five items: fully withdraw the extradition bill, order an independent inquiry into the clashes between protesters and police, retract the “riot” classification of the clashes of June 12, drop the charges against all arrested demonstrators and relaunch the stalled electoral reform process.; Lam has refused all five demands. Instead of saying the bill was withdrawn, she declared it to be “dead”, insisting it held greater finality than “withdrawn” as the latter meant a piece of legislation could be reintroduced.; On the call to have the riot charges dropped, Lam said the terminology had no effect on the actual legal case brought to bear on those arrested on June 12. At the time, none of the 64 people arrested had been charged, even though others detained more recently have been served court papers.; On the demand for amnesty, opposition supporters like former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang have called for a one-off exercise to all involved in the June 12 clashes. Again, the government has refused, arguing it would weaken the rule of law if investigations and prosecutions were not followed through.; Of the protesters’ five demands, the one that has won the widest support has been the call for a commission of inquiry to investigate police actions. Several observers – including eight former political appointees – have said an inquiry to cover the actions of both protesters and police might even be palatable. Lam has insisted that the Independent Police Complaints Council would do just as good a job.; After last weekend’s mayhem and the start of Monday’s citywide strike, Lam took a tougher stance, reframing the protests as an attack on national sovereignty and the “one country, two systems” principle under which Hong Kong is promised freedoms not allowed in the rest of China.; Her evidence: the protesters’ slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, and their act of throwing the Chinese national flag into Victoria Harbour.; “Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city’s future?” Lam asked. “Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said was to bring collateral damage, will push Hong Kong onto a path of no return.”; The profile of protesters also showed many are young and well educated. More than 60 per cent of participants at various marches and protests since June 9 polled had tertiary education or above.; Asked which of eight slogans could represent the movement since June, 92.6 per cent in Tseung Kwan O and Western district chose “No rioters, only tyranny”, compared with 68.5 per cent who chose “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, the slogan that surfaced in the past two weeks or so.; The slogan was used by pro-independence activist Edward Leung Tin-kei when he ran for the legislature in a 2016 by-election. Leung, now serving a six-year jail term over his role in the 2016 Mong Kok riot, said then he was representing an era of people willing to spend “blood and sweat” to fight for their freedoms.; A government source said that, no matter how wide the scope, police would unavoidably be targeted in the inquiry.; Other parts of this series have examined why Hong Kong protesters view the police as the enemy, how leaders have spurned the chance to listen to public opinion and why does Beijing keep getting Hong Kong wrong?","The owner of several major shopping centres in Hong Kong has asked police not to enter its malls unless a crime has taken place, after anti-government protesters threatened to disrupt businesses at one location. Wharf Real Estate Investment Company’s decision partly prompted protesters to call off a plan to swarm the Harbour City centre it manages in Tsim Sha Tsui on Thursday. The move came after another developer faced a backlash earlier for allegedly mishandling clashes between protesters and the force at one of its arcades. Organisers had wanted to stage protests to force major companies to support their demands for the withdrawal of the now-abandoned extradition bill, and the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the police’s handling of the ongoing demonstrations. Notices placed at Harbour City and other locations managed by Wharf Reic, including Times Square in Causeway Bay, and Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill, read: “We will do our best to ensure customers’ safety in the mall. Police, please do not enter unless crimes happen.” Protesters have removed two Chinese national flags from a flagpole outside Harbour City near Star Ferry Pier and have thrown it into the sea twice in three days. The area where the pole stands is also managed by the real estate company. In a press conference on Thursday to announce the interim 2019 results of Wharf (Holdings), Stephen Ng Tin-hoi, the chairman and managing director of both companies, dodged questions on whether there were plans to protect the flag. But Ng said the notices had been put up out of a basic consideration for everyone’s safety in the shopping centres. “We see some things happening in some places,” he said. “We think we need to protect people who come here as patrons or workers. We need to be responsible for their safety. For everything else, it will be done in accordance with Hong Kong’s law.” Doreen Lee Yuk-fong, Wharf Reic’s vice chairwoman, said on Tuesday police intervention should be avoided if they could. Hours after Harbour City put up the notices, protesters announced online at around 12.30am on Thursday that their planned “Summer Happy Hour” protest that evening would be cancelled. They said the decision was made after listening to the views of online activists, who said a protest might have an adverse effect, and they should target the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin instead. “Apart from accepting your suggestions, the event has been cancelled because Harbour City has made clear its stance on how to handle police,” organisers said. The Sha Tin mall is owned by Hong Kong’s leading developer, Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), and its management was pulled into trouble after some protesters accused it of allowing police to enter the mall to arrest demonstrators last month. The operation ended in clashes that injured at least 22 people. Hundreds of angry local residents later besieged the customer service centre there to demand an explanation on the matter, despite SHKP insisting it did not call police, and was not aware in advance of the force’s deployment and subsequent dispersal operation on its premises. The Post has reached out to police for comment on the Wharf Reic notices. Police officers can enter and search any premises without a warrant, if they have reason to believe a person to be arrested is inside, according to the Community Legal Information Centre of the University of Hong Kong. SHKP did not answer when asked whether it would follow Wharf Reic’s example. But it said it would adopt various measures to safeguard the safety of retail employees and customers, including the use of text messages to notify shops about the latest situation at the malls and revising its emergency response system.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3022032/hong-kong-mall-owner-bows-protester-pressure-and-bans

Former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing, a respected veteran who oversaw operations during the 2014 Occupy protests and the 2016 Mong Kok riot, was officially appointed by the government as duty commissioner on special duty on Friday, confirming the Post report. Lau, well known for his tough style of leadership, was also in charge of security when President Xi Jinping visited the city in 2017. Lau began his one-year pre-retirement leave in November, when he hit the mandatory retirement age of 57. The main duties of Lau, who will report for duty on Friday, would be assisting the police commissioner in handling large-scale public order events, steering the forthcoming major operations, including celebratory events for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, according to the announcement. Several police sources said on Thursday he had been appointed for six months to take charge of the response to the protest violence, which has been spreading and intensifying over the past two months, with police stations, frontline officers and even their homes coming under attack. Sources said Lau returned to police headquarters in Wan Chai on Thursday to prepare for his new role, and would be meeting all top brass and district commanders on Friday morning to discuss strategy. “He is very experienced and the force believes he can enhance strategic command and oversee public order events,” one source said. A high-ranking officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “He is the best-qualified person to guide the force through the present challenge and set us on the right course for our future.” Another source, a retired senior officer, welcomed Lau’s appointment, describing him as a “capable and hands-on” leader who had shown his competence and effectiveness in 2014, when protesters demanding greater democracy occupied key roads for 79 straight days, and in 2016, when Mong Kok was rocked by a riot during a crackdown on illegal hawkers. The source described Lau’s return as “extremely rare” and an “earthquake” for the police force, as it could entail a shake-up of top brass. There were plenty of raised eyebrows among the ranks, given that the current man in charge of operations, Chris Tang Ping-keung, was being groomed for the post of police commissioner. Just last year, Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung’s contract was extended for another 12 months, as a third of senior management were within a year of retirement. The extension was intended to smooth the transition to new management, with Senior Assistant Commissioner Tang replacing Lau. At a press conference on Thursday, Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung from the Police Public Relations Branch would only say: “If we really have a reappointment of former officers, we will issue an official announcement in due course.” Police were gearing up for another mass protest at Hong Kong International Airport starting from Friday morning. Online forums were abuzz with plans to stage a “passenger greeting” rally in the arrival hall that would last until Sunday, prompting the Airport Authority to take contingency measures and step up security. Only departing travellers with air tickets or boarding passes for the next 24 hours and a valid travel document, or airport staff with proof of identity, would be allowed to access check-in aisles at Terminal 1 from 6am to 11.59pm between August 9 and 11, the authority announced. In what appeared to be an internal notice circulating online, airport workers were also reminded that people seeing off travellers would only be allowed to go through the check-in aisles accompanying them, and those wearing surgical masks would be required to take them off to make sure they were not protesters. Police said the force had not received any application for permission to hold the rally, and urged protesters to stay peaceful if they went ahead with what would be an illegal gathering. “We are aware that several countries have issued travel warnings against Hong Kong, urging their citizens to exercise caution,” Tse said. “If any protesters stage rallies at the airport, I hope they will be peaceful and law-abiding. Do not commit any disorderly acts that will affect both citizens and passengers.” Tse also warned protesters might have broken the law during the last rally at the airport with actions which they considered peaceful. He said that included forming a human barricade to block people from leaving, even if their hands were raised as proof they were not attacking anyone, as offences such as common assault and unlawful detention charges could still apply.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3022018/senior-hong-kong-policeman-comes-out-retirement-lead

Lai Wai-bond, 34, is alleged to have damaged the Clock Tower in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday, and is also said to have injured Lee Fook-peng near the colonial landmark. The city has been embroiled in a series of protests for nine straight weeks, primarily over the government’s controversial extradition bill. Now abandoned, the bill would have allowed Hong Kong to transfer fugitives to jurisdictions with which it does not have extradition agreement, including mainland China. Although the government has suspended the bill, increasingly violent protesters want it withdrawn completely, and an independent commission of inquiry created to look into accusations of excessive use of force by police. On Thursday, Lai appeared at Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts wearing a patient’s shirt after being hospitalised after his arrest on August 7. Lai is accused of spray-painting the phrase, “50 years of no changes, it’s all gibberish”, on the clock tower, which was built in 1915, in Chinese. The phrase apparently refers to a pledge made to Hongkongers by China’s late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, that the former British colony would remain highly autonomous for half a century after its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Lai is accused of attacking Lee with a bag of spray cans, according to prosecutors outside court. In court, Lai did not explain a plaster on his forehead, or why he had been admitted to hospital. He asked only for an adjournment so he could seek legal advice. Magistrate Ho Chun-yiu granted him HK$2,000 bail, and ordered him to report to a police station weekly.

On Wednesday Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily, singled out the officer, whom they identified only by his surname Lau, for praise, saying he had only raised his gun because he had no other way of defending himself. The Hong Kong anti-government protests, which have continued for nine weeks, have put an immense strain on the police force once described as Asia’s finest. Officers have been heavily criticised in Hong Kong and accused of excessive use of tear gas, firing “non-lethal” rubber bullets and sponge grenades at protesters, civilians and journalists, and aiming batons at people’s heads. Live news footage of officers chatting to attackers and walking past their stronghold led to furious accusations that they were colluding with the triads, and chants of “corrupt police” and “dog officials” have been regularly heard at protests and confrontations with residents since then. But on the mainland, many social media users have denounced the violence and protests in Hong Kong, echoing calls in state media to support the police and calling for tougher measures to restore peace and stability. A video published by People's Daily on Sunday claimed that foreign media reports had been “selectively blind” in criticising police measures for being too extreme, but ignored how violent the protests had become, with bricks being thrown and lasers shone in officers’ eyes. The video said Hong Kong police had suffered, repeating comments made earlier by the force that officers had been attacked, that one had his finger bitten off and that private details of officers and their families had been posted online. “Time will prove the value of them sticking to their posts,” the video said. Many web users left comments under the videos supporting the police and calling for tougher measures, saying news of the unrest was saddening. On Wednesday, CCTV host Hai Xia also praised the city’s police, saying Chinese people supported them. “It’s the police responsibility to guard our homes and protect their loved ones. Hong Kong police, you are guarding peace in society on the front line, 1.4 billion Chinese are standing behind you guarding you. Lau, Sir [a common Chinese term of respect for officers], we support you!” During the clash on July 30 when Lau pointed his gun at the crowd, hundreds of protesters had surrounded the Tin Shui Wai and Kwai Chung for hours. Hong Kong Police Force said in a statement the next day that the police officer “raised a shotgun loaded with beanbag rounds” to “protect himself from the threat of death or serious injury” since his helmet had been taken by protesters. Police have also released multiple statements condemning violence during the protests. Dixon Sing Ming, a political-science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said that in recent weeks it had become apparent that the Beijing authorities were using mainland media to push their official line on the protests. “The purpose is to divide the support of mainlanders for Hong Kong protesters and to justify the mainland government’s further suppression of the protests, whether directly or indirectly,” he said. “How Hongkongers view this is the polar opposite of what state media is trying to say.” Sing said it was important not only to consider Hong Kong public opinion about the violence that erupted during protests but also how people regarded the police’s increasingly heavy tactics and who people blamed for the situation. According to a poll from the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute last week that interviewed 1,007 people, people rated Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the Hong Kong Police Force and the central government as the top three causes of the crisis in the city. Since violence started escalating in Hong Kong with national symbols, such as the Chinese crest and flag being targeted by protesters, mainland criticism of the protests – both official and from members of the public – has become increasingly harsh. Beijing has also reiterated its “unflagging support” for Lam and warned that the city was entering “a most dangerous phase”. At a seminar across the border in Shenzhen on Wednesday, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city’s most urgent task was to stop violence. He urged the pro-government camp to “have no fears and stand up” to safeguard the rule of law and restore stability. Wang Zhimin, director of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong, further urged the delegation to organise rallies to demonstrate the “positive energy” of the city, citing two previous ones supporting the government and police on June 30 and July 20.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/society/article/3021987/hong-kong-policeman-filmed-aiming-gun-protesters-hailed-hero
Top Chinese envoy in Hong Kong demands that US consul ‘make a clean break from anti-China forces’ after Joshua Wong meeting,"This comes as American travel advisory puts Hong Kong on the same warning level as mainland China, Britain and Sri Lanka; Wong meanwhile laughs off collusion allegation in Facebook post","1:33pm, 8 Aug, 2019","The incident outside Kwai Chung police station on July 30 prompted extensive criticism in the city at the time, but police defended the officer’s actions by saying the sergeant was in fear of his life after being surrounded by protesters and losing his helmet.; They have also faced widespread public anger after they were slow to respond to a gang who indiscriminately attacked civilians at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21.","The top Chinese envoy in Hong Kong has demanded that the US consulate “make a clean break from anti-China forces” following media reports of a meeting between an official and local independence activists, including Joshua Wong Chi-fung. On Thursday the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed “strong disapproval” and “firm opposition”, demanding clarification over a meeting two days earlier between United States consulate political counsellor Julie Eadeh and Wong, Nathan Law Kwun-chung, as well as fellow core members of local political party Demosisto. In a statement, the office also labelled the activists “anti-China forces who stir up trouble in Hong Kong”. Demosisto previously said it supported self-determination for Hong Kong, but the office quoted media reports saying the group advocated independence. The meeting came amid weeks of protests in Hong Kong – triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill – which have prompted the US government to escalate its travel advisory to the city. On Thursday the US Department of State raised its travel advisory to level two, asking the public to “exercise increased caution in Hong Kong due to civil unrest”. It puts the city on the same level as mainland China, Britain and Sri Lanka. It noted that several large-scale and smaller political demonstrations had taken place in various areas of Hong Kong since June. While most had been peaceful, some have “turned confrontational or resulted in violent clashes”. “The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighbourhoods other than those where police have permitted marches or rallies. These demonstrations, which can take place with little or no notice, are likely to continue,” the department said. It advised US citizens travelling to Hong Kong to monitor local media for updates, avoid areas of the demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests. The Australian government on Tuesday also raised its advice level for Hong Kong, warning its citizens in the city to “exercise a high degree of caution”. On Eadeh’s meeting with Wong and Law, a spokesman for the foreign ministry commissioner’s office said: “China is rock-firm in upholding national sovereignty and security, as well as Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, and in opposing any interference in Hong Kong affairs by any country, organisation or individual in whatever form. “We strongly urge the members of the US [consulate] to … immediately make a clean break from anti-China forces who stir up trouble in Hong Kong, stop sending out wrong signals to violent offenders, refrain from meddling with Hong Kong affairs, and avoid going further down the wrong path.” The meeting came to light after reports by some pro-Beijing newspapers that the US consul and Demosisto activists were “plotting to come up with plans regarding the extradition bill”. In response to the commissioner’s office statement, a spokesman for the US consulate in Hong Kong said: “Representatives of the US government meet regularly with a wide cross section of people across Hong Kong and Macau. For example, on the day of this particular meeting, our diplomats also met both pro-establishment and pan-democratic camp legislators, as well as members of the American business community and the consular corps.” On China’s claims that the protests in Hong Kong were fuelled by foreign forces, the spokesman added: “We categorically reject the charge of foreign forces as being behind the protests. It is not credible to think that millions of people are being manipulated to stand for a free and open society.” The spokesman also urged Beijing to respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy. “We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong,” he said. In a message posted on his Facebook page, Joshua Wong laughed off allegations he was colluding with the US. Wong said they were only discussing the legislation of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and that his group urged the US to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to Hong Kong’s police. “I had visited Washington and had an exchange with US congressmen. Nathan Law even met the US secretary of state in May. So, what is the big deal?” he said in the post.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021941/us-government-increases-travel-warning-hong-kong-telling

Protesters were angry he was arrested for merely having the laser pointers in a plastic bag, and not because he flashed them at police officers.; On Wednesday, police showed during a press conference that Fong’s laser pointers were powerful enough to burn a hole in a sheet of paper. However, those present noted that the officers held the pointer very close to the paper during the demonstration at police headquarters.","The arrest of Baptist University student leader Keith Fong Chung-yin on Tuesday on suspicion of possessing offensive weapons – 10 laser pointers he had just bought in Sham Shui Po – has caused an uproar among anti-government protesters. Are laser pointers considered dangerous weapons in Hong Kong? Laser pointers – which police referred to as “laser guns” – are not illegal. But under the Air Navigation (Hong Kong) Order, it is an offence to exhibit “any light” glaring enough to endanger aircraft taking off or landing. This apparently includes the beams from laser pointers. Police have hit out repeatedly at protesters for pointing laser beams at the eyes of officers during recent protests. They say there are various ways of defining what can be considered a dangerous weapon under the law. An object that in itself is not a weapon, but is used to attack a person, may be deemed an offensive weapon. Lawyer Daniel Wong Kwok-tung said in order for an object to be deemed an offensive weapon, a person should be caught in the act of attacking another with the object. He said if laser pointers are considered weapons because they were used during protests, umbrellas could be declared weapons too. A spokesman for the human rights group Civil Rights Observer, Icarus Wong Ho-yin, said that going by the police explanation, “a kitchen worker who buys a few knives can be arrested for being in possession of offensive weapons”. What harm can the pointers do? Are there any required safety standards? Dr William Cheung Sing-wai, a former associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Hong Kong, said laser pointers could be dangerous if pointed at the eyes. “Laser pointers, especially those with high power, can burn your skin and cause permanent injury to the eyes,” he said. Even pointers with power ratings of only 1 milliwatt can cause harm to the eyes, he said, and the injury would be worse for more powerful beams. The laser pointers commonly used by teachers are less than 1 milliwatt devices, he added. On Wednesday, police cited medical experts who said laser beams shone at the eyes of officers could cause temporary or permanent harm to their vision. The Customs and Excise Department said laser pointers are regulated by the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, and the subsidiary Consumer Goods Safety Regulation. These laws state goods sold in the city must meet a “general safety requirement”, in keeping with “reasonable safety standards published by a standards institute or similar body”. How do other countries regulate laser pointers? In 2008, Australia banned laser pointers capable of emitting beams exceeding 1 milliwatt. The move followed a series of coordinated incidents in Sydney, when pilots complained that high-intensity lasers were being shone into the cockpit during take-off and landing. The government called the incidents “a gutless and cowardly act” that could result in a horrific outcome. Laser pointers with power ratings over 1 milliwatt are also illegal in Britain. According to the BBC, between 2012 and 2018, at least 47 children in Britain suffered permanent eye damage because of laser pointers. In Canada, it is illegal to possess laser pointers of more than 1 milliwatt in some public areas unless they are for work or education purposes. How powerful are laser pointers used for stargazing? According to Huey Pang, president of the astronomy association AstroLink, laser pointers have been used by stargazers for about 15 years. Initially, they had power ratings of about 10 milliwatts. But as light pollution has become more serious in Hong Kong, stargazers now use laser pointers that can emit 50-milliwatt beams. These devices are easily available in Sham Shui Po for less than HK$100. More powerful pointers cost more.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021870/laser-pointers-are-not-illegal-hong-kong-are-they

In the British colonial period, Chinese became an official language only in 1974, so non-English speakers could represent themselves in court without having to rely on a translator. ; But since 1997, the language of choice has been predominantly Chinese. According to academics at universities, as well people in the business sector, proficiency in English in our so-called world city has declined.; Hong Kong continues to describe itself as an international city. It is ironic that during these weeks of crisis, live television news coverage of the protests is only in Chinese. Even the ticker tape running across the screen is in Chinese, not English.; Rachel Yeo’s informative article (“How the city’s Reddit-like forum LIHKG has become the leading platform for organising demonstrations”, August 3) clearly explains how a few tens of thousands on a forum with technological infrastructure provided by an American cloud-computing service are able to hold us to ransom.

Laser pointers are in the spotlight in Hong Kong’s protests and selling briskly.

The Post was not able to get the same result using a 10cm laser pointer with an output range of 1-5 milliwatts bought from Apliu Street.","Laser pointers were selling fast in Sham Shui Po’s well-known electronics flea market on Wednesday, a day after a university student leader was arrested there for having several of the devices which the police branded “offensive weapons”. Laser pointers emitting green and blue beams of light have been used widely in recent extradition bill protests, apparently to confuse police officers and deter passers-by from taking photographs that might help identify protesters. “We only sell two types, and they are both only 1.6 milliwatts,” said one stall owner. “Of course, you don’t point it into people’s eyes.” He declined to say how many he had sold. There were long queues in front of stalls selling laser pointers at about HK$60 apiece. Bigger ones with red beams were also available, at HK$150 each. The queues disappeared as the stalls ran out of stock. To meet demand, one stall keeper was seen modifying torch lights by unscrewing the top layer of glass, which disperses light, to create a single, focused beam. Other stall owners, who enthusiastically waved customers over and explained the difference between the laser pointers on sale, turned unfriendly when the Post approached them, apparently aware that laser pointers had become a sensitive subject. Laser pointers remain available on e-commerce site Taobao. Referring to the laser pointers as “laser guns”, police said three officers needed medical treatment after protesters pointed beams at them. “Laser pointers, especially those with high power, can burn one’s skin and cause permanent injury to the eyes,” said Dr William Cheung Sing-wai, a former electrical engineering associate professor at the University of Hong Kong. He said laser pointers used by teachers had a power range of less than 1 milliwatt, but even those could cause an eye injury. Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said “laser guns” were not considered prohibited weapons in the city. But he said the laser pointers seized by police breached the Trade Descriptions Ordinance for failing to display energy levels or warning labels. The case has been passed to customs officials. Asked whether people using laser pointers for stargazing on Wednesday night could be arrested if they used them for other purposes, Li said a device would be considered an offensive weapon only when used to harm others. “If all those people use them for gazing at the stars, they don’t need to worry about being arrested,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021897/laser-pointers-are-spotlight-hong-kongs-protests-and

Officials have been forced to go on a blitz recently against misinformation and false news claiming, among other things, that a curfew was about to be imposed, that People’s Liberation Army soldiers were being deployed in disguise as Hong Kong police officers, and that Lam was taking a week-long holiday. One academic even said officials should learn from US President Donald Trump and use social media to fight back. The latest rumour to prompt a denial by the government on Wednesday concerned claims that the justice minister had rejected a proposal by her right-hand man, the director of public prosecutions, to set up an “independent prosecution committee” to handle cases involving extradition bill protests. Half a day after that made headlines on major online news platforms, the justice department issued a brief statement dismissing the news as “totally unfounded”. Professor Leung Tin-wai, a veteran newsman and head of Shue Yan University’s department of journalism and communication, said: “The spread of fake news is a sign that the public is losing confidence in the government. People easily choose to believe rumours, especially those against the government.” Agreeing, Professor Clement So York-kee, of the School of Journalism and Communication at Chinese University, said: “People rely too heavily on social media for information nowadays and tend to share it without thinking if it is too explosive to be true. So rumours can spread very quickly.” Referring to recent online rumours that the director of immigration had taken leave to go on strike on Monday, and that PLA soldiers were disguised as Hong Kong police officers, he said: “This could have been a campaign by the anti-government side to undermine public confidence in the government, but it could not have stirred up so much noise if people had confidence in our government.” Leung said officials need to appear in person at more press briefings to dismiss false news, instead of “hiding behind” written statements. “I am not saying that the government is fighting a losing battle, but it has to take a higher profile to reject fake news,” he said. Compared with government officials, the police appear to be more proactive in dismissing rumours concerning the force. At the force’s daily press conference on Wednesday, three allegations by online users were dealt with, including the rumour about PLA soldiers. Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of the force’s public relations branch, showed reporters a screengrab of a video clip which internet users claimed showed police officers in riot gear speaking Mandarin – suggesting they were mainlanders. “The fact is, the officers wearing gas masks cannot be heard clearly when they speak,” he said, dismissing the rumour they were PLA soldiers. Kong also showed a picture of officers changing their clothes in the car park of a police station, and said: “Some people took this photo and accused our colleagues of preparing to do something dodgy. The fact is, they were working outside their district and could not go back. The police station was too crowded, so they changed at the car park and went home.” The third allegation concerned a picture showing officers throwing something at protesters from inside a police station. Kong said it was tear gas – not fire crackers as was alleged. He said the officers did that to protect their colleagues on the ground from being attacked by protesters. Political scientist Chan Wai-keung, from the Hong Kong Community College of Polytechnic University, said officials should take their cue from US President Donald Trump and use more social media to respond to issues. “We are in the 21st century, but our officials still stick to the old ways inherited from colonial days to dispatch news, writing press releases in bureaucratic jargon which are not released before approval is secured from throughout the government hierarchy,” said Chan. “They should learn from Trump. He basically dominates the world media through Twitter. His tweets are simple and to the point. His responses are prompt. You may not agree with what he says, but he sets the agenda of society with one or two lines of words.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/society/article/3021878/be-more-trump-hong-kong-government-told-it-must-change

Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), put the emphasis on ending the protest chaos and violence that began two months ago, triggered by the government’s now-abandoned extradition bill. He also left open the possibility of the Hong Kong government setting up a commission of inquiry into the entire extradition bill saga, in response to citywide calls, but only after the protests ended. “The most pressing and overriding task at present is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, so as to safeguard our homeland and prevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss,” Zhang said. Laying out these priorities before 500 of Hong Kong’s top business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians at a seminar in neighbouring Shenzhen on Wednesday, he called on allies of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s embattled government to do their part in safeguarding Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Speaking at the same event, Wang Zhimin, director of Beijing’s liaison office, warned that the crisis gripping Hong Kong was a “battle of life and death”, with the city’s future at stake. While Beijing officials rallied pro-establishment forces at the day-long seminar, Hong Kong’s leader continued to avoid open public engagements, but quietly made a morale-boosting visit to the Tin Shui Wai Police Station, where tear gas was used to disperse protesters who attacked it on Monday. Lam also, unannounced, visited the site of a new public shopping space in the district and reviewed improvements works at Tai Wai Market. During her first community excursion since the protests began in early June, she promised to come up with measures to improve livelihood in her policy address in October. At the seminar in Shenzhen, Zhang again declared Beijing’s full support for Hong Kong’s leader and police force, stressing that backing them was key to restoring order. “The central government is 100 per cent supportive of Lam’s leadership,” he said. Zhang warned that if the protest crisis escalated beyond the local government’s control, Beijing would not sit by and watch. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could be deployed to restore law and order, while national laws could also apply in a state of emergency. “According to the Basic Law, the central authorities have ample methods as well as sufficient strength to promptly settle any possible turmoil, should it occur,” he said. Former Hong Kong justice minister Elsie Leung Oi-sie, who attended the gathering, said Zhang was making it clear that the central government had the right to step in if necessary. “Beijing will not ignore Hong Kong when it is in chaos,” she said. Leung quoted Zhang as praising Deng Xiaoping as insightful, as the late paramount leader said in the 1980s that Beijing would intervene if disturbance occurred in the city. The seminar in Shenzhen was the first of its kind since the HKMAO and Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong organised a similar event in August 2014, a month before the Occupy protests began and protesters occupied roads for 79 straight days demanding greater democracy. “We can say Hong Kong is facing the most serious situation since the [1997] handover,” said Zhang, in his opening remarks over the first five minutes of the seminar during which the media were allowed in. Ip Kwok-him, a Hong Kong delegate to the National People’s Congress, quoted Zhang as warning that the city would suffer greatly if the protests dragged on, and they should not be allowed to disrupt celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in October. “I believe he was expressing hope that the chaos in Hong Kong would be over by September, but of course, the sooner the better,” Ip said. Zhang described the protests as having “obvious characteristics of a colour revolution,” a reference to civil unrest in countries in the former Soviet Union and Balkans in the early 2000s. New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee cited Zhang as suggesting that such characteristics included the prominent role of youngsters, and the involvement of religious groups. “They use freedom and democracy as slogans but are in fact hurting Hong Kong,” she said. Another attendee said Zhang had noted how colour revolutions had destroyed police morale and allowed protesters to take over. “Police have sweated and bled, we cannot let them cry,” Zhang was quoted as saying. Protesters have made five demands which the government has resisted so far: completely withdraw the bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China; launch an independent inquiry to look into the entire controversy and allegations of police brutality in particular; exonerate those arrested; retract all references to protests as “riots”; and launch the city’s stalled political reform process. Delegates who attended the meeting said Zhang dismissed all the demands, but left open the possibility of setting up a commission of inquiry after order was restored.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021877/protests-colour-revolution-threatening-hong-kong-abyss-top
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reaches out to city’s districts to ‘feel people’s pulse’ and promise better  livelihood options,"Lam visits Tin Shui Wai, Yuen Long and Tai Wai to talk to residents and inspect the damage to a police station vandalised by protesters; Some welcome her impromptu move; others denounce it as a publicity stunt, saying she kept her schedule private to avoid demonstrations","12:15am, 8 Aug, 2019",Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Wednesday visited three suburban districts to talk to residents and inspect the damage at a police station – reaching out to a neighbourhood for the first time since her administration plunged into a political crisis with protests over the now-abandoned extradition bill.,"In a press release issued after the visit, she pledged to roll out more measures to improve people’s livelihood in her upcoming policy speech in October. Without any prior notice, Lam was seen in Tin Shui Wai, Yuen Long and Tai Wai on Wednesday afternoon. Her move was met with mixed responses – some welcomed the attempt to reach out, while others called it a publicity stunt. Images circulated online showed Lam talking to business operators and shoppers in Tai Wai Market. She also set foot in a park in Tin Shui Wai. Her unexpected public appearance with health minister Sophia Chan Siu-chee was not officially confirmed until her office published a press release in the evening. The release said Lam had checked out a site in Tin Shui Wai earmarked for a government-run wet market. Local residents had earlier complained there was no marketplace selling cheap groceries. Later, the chief executive also inspected improvement works at a market in Tai Wai. Before going to Tai Wai, she also visited Tin Shui Wai Police Station, which was vandalised by extradition bill protesters earlier this week, to see the extent of the damage and meet the officers on site. She was quoted as saying: “I will put forward more measures to improve people’s livelihood in the upcoming 2019 Policy Address. A public consultation on the policy address is under way and people are welcome to give their views.” The press release mentioned that a comprehensive review of the operation of public markets was a highlight of Lam’s maiden policy address in 2017. Sha Tin district councillor Li Sai-hung, of the opposition party Neo Democrats, said he only learned of Lam’s arrival from stall operators at the Tai Wai market. “I was told she arrived around 1pm,” he said. “That was a quiet time in the market. Perhaps she chose the time to avoid meeting too many people.” Li said the district council was not told about Lam’s visit. “The stall operators said there was no warm welcome,” Li said. “Lam briefly chatted with them, asked about their business, and left.” Fellow Sha Tin district councillor Tung Kin-lei, of the pro-government Democratic Alliance for Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also said councillors in his camp were not told about the visit in advance. “Perhaps she wanted to feel the real pulse of the people,” Tung said. Zachary Wong Wai-yin, a Yuen Long district councillor, said he learned from local residents that Lam had visited Tin Sau Bazaar in Tin Shui Wai, a pet project pushed by her government to provide a shopping spot for the low-income neighbourhood. “I heard her visit was met with lukewarm response,” Wong said. Wong said he felt Lam’s surprise visit “was only a publicity stunt to show that she still cared about people’s livelihood”. He added: “If she really cared, she would have come to talk to the elected representatives.” Political observer Ivan Choy Chi-keung said Lam’s visits to the communities could be seen as a “business as usual” message that she wanted to deliver after the central government showed its hardline stance on the recent anti-government protests. Choy said Lam might have been so worried about coming across protesters in her way that she chose not to disclose her schedule in advance. “Lam didn’t show up earlier as she was not sure which way to go,” said Choy, adding that she had surfaced after Beijing spelled out its stance on the political crisis. “Her visits will not alleviate the current situation.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021876/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-reaches-out-citys-districts
Protesters shine light on arrest of Hong Kong student with new kind of laser rally,Hundreds gather outside Hong Kong Space Museum to protest arrest of Baptist University student Keith Fong; Student was stopped by off-duty officers after buying 10 laser pointers which police say have been used to attack them,"11:24pm, 7 Aug, 2019",Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Wednesday visited three suburban districts to talk to residents and inspect the damage at a police station – reaching out to a neighbourhood for the first time since her administration plunged into a political crisis with protests over the now-abandoned extradition bill.,"Hundreds gathered outside the Hong Kong Space Museum on Wednesday night for a new kind of protest, shining laser beams on its dome to condemn the arrest of a Baptist University student leader for possessing handheld pointers of the kind regularly used against police by protesters. The rally came hours after police defended the arrest of the student, by demonstrating how the pointers, which they referred to as “laser guns”, were powerful enough burn a hole in a sheet of paper from a short distance in 10 seconds. Police said three officers had required hospital treatment after protesters flashed laser beams at them. It was the second protest since Keith Fong Chung-yin, 20, who heads Baptist University’s students’ union, was arrested by five off-duty officers at around 7.30pm on Tuesday, after he spent HK$4,200 (US$536) to buy 10 of the pointers from a stall in Apliu Street, Sham Shui Po. More than 1,000 protesters, including students from the university, besieged the Sham Shui Po Police Station on Tuesday night, and officers later fired about 20 rounds of tear gas to clear the crowd, who sprayed paint on the building’s walls, and hurled bricks and glass bottles into the complex. Police arrested eight other people during the clearance operation, including another Baptist University student, Chan Ka-shing, for offences including unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers in the execution of their duties. As of Wednesday night, Fong remained detained at the Caritas Medical Centre, where he was sent after complaining of feeling unwell. Chan was released on HK$500 bail (US$64). Baptist University’s president, Roland Chin Tai-hong, wrote in a letter to staff and students that “the latest police actions have caused widespread public concern”, and urged the government and law enforcement authorities to respond positively. Chin, who also went to the tear-gassed protest scene to appeal to other students to leave for safety reasons, said help would be provided to Fong and Chan, who are both first-year European Studies students. At 8pm on Wednesday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the museum in Tsim Sha Tsui, with some shining their pointers at the museum, chanting slogans such as “liberate Hong Kong, a laser pointer revolution”, and singing songs like, I Am Angry, by the now-defunct rock band Beyond. Participants were also heard mocking the police’s claim that the pointers were offensive weapons, saying: “Is the building on fire yet?” Some urged people not to shine their pointers at nearby hotels or at planes. A 40-year-old participant, who gave his name as John, said it was “ridiculous” that Fong had been arrested. “The police cannot just arrest him for what they think are offensive weapons,” he said. “There is no evidence that he was planning to attack someone.” Pinky So Mei-yan, 52, a clerk, said Fong should only be arrested after he had committed a crime, such as using the pointers against officers. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung of the police’s public relations branch warned that the beams emitted could cause “flash blindness” and serious injuries to eyes, adding three officers had needed treatment after demonstrators pointed laser beams at them in recent protests. A police officer used one of the 10 laser pointers Fong bought to show how it could burn a paper within seconds, after pointing the beam at a fixed spot on the sheet one metre away. Democratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun and academics questioned whether police had enough evidence to prove Fong’s motives and arrest him for possessing offensive weapons. Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah, of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau, said Fong had failed to adequately explain why he bought the pointers, and tried to escape when questioned by off-duty officers. A video clip taken by a witness showed Fong explaining after he had been arrested that the laser pointers would be used for stargazing. When asked whether the police’s experiment, which could put the suspect in a disadvantaged position during the trial process, was proper, Li said: “I did not smear him or say what it is used for. I just described the power this laser gun can reach” He added that the demonstration would not be submitted to court. According to the Public Order Ordinance, an offensive weapon is “any article made, or adapted for use, or suitable for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it in his possession or under his control for such use by him or by some other person”. The police did not detail the brand and specifications of the seized laser pointers, and said the packaging provided no relevant information. Meanwhile, hundreds of students, alumni and staff attended a rally at Baptist University on Wednesday evening to voice support for Fong. A total of 45 professors and staff, and close to 500 students and alumni, also signed two separate petitions to condemn the police’s arrest. Bruce Lui Ping-kuen, senior lecturer at the department of journalism, said it was dangerous for the police to presume Fong’s motives. “The basic assumption of law in Hong Kong is that people are presumed innocent,” he said. “If laser pointers can be sold at the shop, it should be legal to buy and own them,” he said.

Business elite and pro-Beijing politicians meet officials from mainland’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Shenzhen to rally support for SAR’s prosperity and stability,"About 500 figures from Hong Kong attended meeting, which called for pro-establishment camp to organise rallies to demonstrate city’s ‘positive energy’; Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong to crowdfund to help those affected by protests","10:21pm, 7 Aug, 2019",Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Wednesday visited three suburban districts to talk to residents and inspect the damage at a police station – reaching out to a neighbourhood for the first time since her administration plunged into a political crisis with protests over the now-abandoned extradition bill.,"About 500 business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians were in Shenzhen on Wednesday to hear Beijing officials call for support in safeguarding Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Among them were Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce chairman Aron Harilela, Sun Hung Kai Properties executive director Adam Kwok Kai-fai, Executive Council members Bernard Chan, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Tommy Cheung Yu-yan, former justice secretary Elsie Leung Oi-sie, former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing, and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office deputy director Huang Liuquan and spokeswoman Xu Luying. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HSBC Asia-Pacific Peter Wong Tung-shun, former Wharf Holdings chairman Peter Woo Kwong-ching, and former police chief Andy Tsang Wai-hung also attended as local delegates to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPCCC). But former Hong Kong leaders and CPPCC vice-chairmen Tung Chee-hwa and Leung Chun-ying were not there. Also missing were a number of other prominent CPPCC delegates, including tycoon Li Ka-shing’s son Victor Li Tzar-kuoi and Henderson Land’s Peter Lee Ka-kit. At the meeting, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city’s most urgent task was to stop violence and urged the pro-government camp to “have no fears and stand up”, using different ways to confront as to safeguard the rule of law and restore stability. Wang Zhimin, director of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong, further urged the delegation to organise rallies to demonstrate the “positive energy” of the city, citing the success of the two previous ones supporting the government and police on June 30 and July 20. “We hope you will all be persistent in improving things with young people,” he added. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said the party would mobilise public support by organising different activities, and it would set up a platform connecting all those affected by the recent protests. “We would want to set up a fund through crowdfunding, as to assist those innocent civilians who have been affected by the recent spate of protests,” Lee said. “Many citizens are angry about the situation but do not dare to raise their voices. I believe a platform would help their voices be heard.” Ip Kwok-Him, an executive councillor, said the fund would help people whose livelihoods have been affected, referring to reports of a van driver whose vehicle was vandalised after he clashed with protesters. The DAB is viewed as the most resourceful party in the city. In a single fundraising dinner in 2016, the party raised more than HK$60 million (US$7.65 million). But pan-democrat lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung believed the party’s planned crowdfunding drive was less about raising finances than a tactic to mobilise public support. “I am worried that the tactic of stirring up struggles between people will encourage clashes with protesters,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021871/business-elite-and-pro-beijing-politicians-meet-officials
Taiwan bubble tea chains face backlash in mainland China after Hong Kong franchises ‘express support for protesters’,Angry social media users call for boycott of Yifang Fruit Tea and CoCo after franchises urged Hongkongers to ‘add oil’ amid wave of protests,"9:42pm, 7 Aug, 2019","A photo of a receipt apparently issued by the CoCo franchise in the city’s Wan Chai district, dated June 16 – a day when two million people took to the streets to protest against a proposed extradition law – also featured the phrase “Hongkongers, add oil!” and generated a further round of social media outrage.; But mainland internet users complained that its website lists Taiwan, Hong Kong and China as a separate territories – a regular bugbear for Beijing, which insists Taiwan is an integral part of China.; A number of foreign brands have also found themselves caught in a tug of war between Hong Kong and mainland customers since the start of the protests.","Popular Taiwanese bubble tea chains are facing an angry backlash from mainland Chinese consumers after some of their franchises in Hong Kong appeared to express support for the anti-government protests that have swept the city. Pictures of a branch of Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea that closed during Monday’s citywide strike went viral on Weibo, the mainland’s most popular social media network, because of a notice in its window that read: “We are closing the business for a day with the rest of Hong Kong. Hongkongers, add oil!” – a popular phrase adopted by the protesters. It is not known which of the city’s 20 branches was shown in the photo. “Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea, I don’t know if you’re joking or whether this is deliberate. If it is intentional, then I will never drink your tea ever again in my life,” wrote a Weibo user in a post on Wednesday that gained more than 24,000 likes. Other users boasted of putting the brand on their personal blacklist of Taiwanese brands suspected of supporting independence for the island. Other Taiwanese bubble tea chains have also been dragged into the latest controversy – particularly CoCo Fresh Tea & Juice. A third Taiwanese chain, Gong Cha, was also singled out despite no evidence that its franchises in the city have expressed any views on the ongoing protests. There are more than 200 Yifang stores in mainland China, and its distributor there tried to address the complaints by putting out a statement on its official Weibo account condemning the protests, which have been denounced in state media for undermining the country’s sovereignty. “We resolutely safeguard ‘one country, two systems’ and opposite violent strike action,” the statement said. “Yifang Fruit Tea stores will continue to operate.” But a number of the chain’s franchises in Taiwan and the firm’s official Hong Kong operation then issued their own statements distancing themselves from the comment. “Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea Hong Kong does not operate any Weibo account, our official social media accounts are only Facebook and Instagram,” a notice posted on Facebook on Monday evening read. “The statement posted online this afternoon has nothing to do with the Hong Kong official distributor. “We must clarify here that Yifang is a Taiwanese brand, and that the operation and management of all its Hong Kong branches are always represented by Hong Kong people. “The Hong Kong general distributor respects the individual political positions of the various branches, and strongly believes that Hong Kong is an inclusive, free and open place.” In Taiwan, the company also distanced itself from the Weibo statement – which in turn risked a backlash from its local customers – saying it was a “non-political brand” that wanted to focus on selling fruit tea drinks. Even Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen weighed in on Tuesday, saying “natural fruit teas are certainly the best out of all of them, but they don’t taste good if they are flavoured with politics”. Meanwhile, a joint Facebook statement signed by six Yifang branches in Taipei and Kaohsiung on Monday said they “oppose one country, two systems” and “fully support Hong Kong citizens who are bravely resisting the totalitarian government’s unreasonable treatment”. One country, two systems is the governance model used in Hong Kong since the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997. The system technically preserves the semi-autonomous city’s remaining privileges, including rule of law and freedom of speech, but mass social unrest during the current anti-government protests and the 2014 Occupy Movement have highlighted widespread public anxiety over its limitations in the face of Beijing’s tightening control. The Hong Kong anti-government protests and protesters’ increasing demands for universal suffrage have been met with broad support in Taiwan. The Japanese sports drink Pocari Sweat has been widely praised by Hongkongers and featured prominently in some protests after it pulled advertising from a local television station accused of pro-China bias – a move that in turn triggered calls for a boycott on the mainland. But another Japanese brand – the restaurant chain Yoshinoya – has been targeted by Hongkongers over the pro-establishment views expressed by the boss of the holding company that runs the chain’s operations on the mainland. CoCo and Gong Cha did not respond to requests for comment.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/society/article/3021854/taiwan-bubble-tea-chains-face-backlash-mainland-china-after-hong
"Hong Kong police defend arrest of Baptist University student leader for possessing laser pointers, even as lawmaker and professors question evidence to prove motive of accused","Police call items ‘laser guns’ and defend arrest by demonstrating power of beams they produced at press conference; Lawmaker and professors condemn arrest, saying pointers were bought legally and it was not clear if they were meant to harm anyone","9:41pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Police said three of their officers needed medical treatment during the protests and violent clashes over the now-abandoned extradition bill in the past two months, after demonstrators pointed lasers at them.; “More than 1,000 protesters surrounded Sham Shui Po police station. They hurled bricks and glass bottles into the station and spray-painted on the outer walls, causing damage,” Tse said.; Upon learning some students were also the among hundreds gathered around the police station, Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong and his colleagues, who visited Fong in hospital earlier, went to the spot to persuade them to leave for safety reasons.","Hong Kong police have defended the arrest of a student leader for possessing 10 laser pointers by experimentally showing at a press conference on Wednesday how the beams they emitted could burn a hole in sheet of paper in 10 seconds. Describing the seized items as “laser guns”, Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung of Police Public Relations Branch said the beams could “flash blind” someone and also cause serious eye injuries. To make their point, police pointed one of the lasers at a piece of paper no more than arm’s length away. The force conducted their demonstration less than 24 hours after Keith Fong Chung-yin, 20, the president of Baptist University Students’ Union, was arrested for possessing 10 of the pointers. Fong was taken into custody after he spent HK$4,200 (US$536) to buying pointers from a stall in Apliu Street, Sham Shui Po, at about 7.30pm on Tuesday. His arrest prompted hundreds of protesters to besiege the district police station that evening. Police fired tear gas to clear the crowd and arrested nine people, including another Baptist University student, Chan Ka-shing. Steve Li Kwai-wah, the senior superintendent of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau, said before purchasing the pointers, Fong had asked stall operators how powerful the beams were. “After the purchase, he was found acting suspiciously and wandering around when our off-duty officers intercepted him,” he said. Democratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun questioned whether police had enough evidence to arrest Fong, while Li said Fong had failed to adequately explain why he bought the pointers. “Had he given a reasonable explanation and addressed the concerns, our colleagues would have released him. But he chose not to, and tried to escape,” Li said. Police later arrested Fong and seized 10 pointers he was carrying in a polythene bag. A video clip taken by a witness showed Fong trying to explain to police following his arrest that he would use the pointers to gaze at the stars. When asked whether the police considered it proper to demonstrate how the articles could burn a paper as that could put the suspect in a disadvantaged position during the trial, Li said he found it his responsibility to inform the public about the dangers the weapons posed. “I did not smear him or tell what it is used for. I just tell the power of this laser gun can reach this level.” He added they would only submit data and statements to the court, not the demonstration. Barrister Albert Luk Wai-hung said using an exhibit in a press conference would not be considered as perverting the course of justice. Luk assured the city’s judges would be fair and not be affected by the presser as the demonstration was no evidence presented to the court. Still, he said the act of tampering with the exhibits was improper, because the objects should not be interfered with before presenting to the court unless necessary. Later on, the defence could cast doubt on whether the object should be used as an exhibit in the court, he added. According to the Public Order Ordinance, an offensive weapon is any article made, or adapted for use, or suitable for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it in his possession or under his control for such use by him or by some other person. Asked about the brand and model specifications of the seized articles, Li said: “The packaging has no such description.” But Li admitted the power of the beams would be weakened if used from a longer distance. Fong’s arrest on Tuesday prompted a heavy crowd to surround five off-duty officers who then called in police reinforcements. Fong complained of feeling unwell and was taken to Caritas Medical Centre for treatment. A large crowd quickly besieged the Sham Shui Po Police Station to demand Fong’s release. “Their acts put officers and other citizens in danger.” He said police had no choice but to fire tear gas to disperse protesters and restore public order at about 2am on Wednesday. During crowd dispersal, around 20 rounds of tear gas were fired and nine people – seven men and two women – were arrested for various offences, including unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers in execution of duty. Chin said the police action had caused widespread public concern, and urged the government and law enforcement authorities to respond positively. Some 45 professors and administrative staff of the university, along with 488 alumni and current students from the Department of Government and International Studies, have signed a petition to condemn the arrest. The professors said that whatever reason Fong bought the laser pointers for, the fact that he bought them legally should not be a reason for his arrest. Bruce Lui, senior lecturer in journalism at the university, said: “The basic assumption of law in Hong Kong is that people are presumed innocent. If laser pointers can be sold at a shop, it should be legal to buy and possess them.” “We should presume ordinary people are innocent unless you have a strong proof before accusing them.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021862/hong-kong-police-defend-arrest-baptist-university
"Hong Kong’s justice department denies prosecution of protesters is politically motivated, as 3,000 of city’s legal profession take part in second silent march","Accusation made by lawmaker Dennis Kwok as 3,000 members of city’s legal profession take part in second silent march; Leading members of profession also call for independent investigation into political crisis","9:29pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Police said three of their officers needed medical treatment during the protests and violent clashes over the now-abandoned extradition bill in the past two months, after demonstrators pointed lasers at them.; “More than 1,000 protesters surrounded Sham Shui Po police station. They hurled bricks and glass bottles into the station and spray-painted on the outer walls, causing damage,” Tse said.; Upon learning some students were also the among hundreds gathered around the police station, Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong and his colleagues, who visited Fong in hospital earlier, went to the spot to persuade them to leave for safety reasons.","Thousands of legal professionals in Hong Kong took part in a second silent march in two months on Wednesday, to voice their discontent at the “political prosecution” of anti-government protesters. The group, which organiser and legal sector lawmaker Dennis Kwok Wing-hang said involved 3,000 people at its peak, also called on the government to formally withdraw the now-abandoned extradition bill, and launch an independent inquiry into the whole political crisis. “The legal sector does not accept political prosecution,” said Kwok, outside the Department of Justice building in Admiralty, along with hundreds of lawyers who stood in sweltering midday heat after a short march from the Court of Final Appeal in Central. Kwok said they demanded a face-to-face conversation with Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, and the Director of Public Prosecutions David Leung Cheuk-yin. “Cheng needs to come out and tell us whether the prosecutorial decisions made recently were politically motivated,” Kwok said. “Why are the assailants who attacked citizens yet to be prosecuted, while the young protesters are charged with rioting?” The lawmaker was referring to the mob of men in white T-shirts who indiscriminately attacked passengers with rods and metal poles at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21. So far 24 men have been arrested for unlawful assembly over the incident, but none have been charged. In contrast, 44 of those who took part in a protest in Sheung Wan seven days later have already been charged with rioting. Kwok also urged the justice department to set up an independent unit to handle prosecutions related to the ongoing protests, and to keep Cheng completely away from deciding charges. They said as a principal official responsible for pushing the bill, she had a conflict of interest. Earlier on Wednesday on a radio programme, Kwok claimed Leung had proposed the creation of an “independent prosecution committee” to handle cases related to the protests, only to be overruled by Cheung. The Department of Justice called the report “totally unfounded”, and said Cheng and Leung were “deeply disappointed” by it. The extradition bill, if passed, would have allowed Hong Kong to transfer fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city did not have an extradition agreement, including mainland China. By Wednesday, 589 people, aged between 13 and 76, had been arrested during numerous marches, rallies, demonstrations and clashes between police and protesters since June 9. Legal heavyweight and former Executive Council member Denis Chang Khen-lee QC joined the rally and spoke in public for the first time since the protests broke out. He urged the government to listen to the “silent scream” of the city’s legal profession. “But we do not just scream,” he said. “We want law, order, justice and peace.” Chang, who led the Independent Police Complaints Council for six years until 1998, said an independent investigation into the political crisis was necessary, and warned that whoever talked about the rule of law should not mistake law as an instrument to control people. “The law has also the control of people in power,” Chang said. Stephen Char Shik-ngor, a former chief investigator for the Independent Commission Against Corruption, said no one could tell if the formal withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry would stop the protests. “But at least [the government] should do it to cool down the situation … it is doing nothing up to now,” he said. In response to the march and rally, a justice department spokesman said Cheng, Leung and the prosecution team had discharged their duties fairly and without prejudice or favour, so as to safeguard criminal justice. The department would not handle the cases differently because of the political beliefs or backgrounds of people involved, the spokesman said. In a statement the department said the time required to make prosecutorial decisions depended on a number of factors, including the time it took to investigate, the amount of evidence, and the complexity of a case. “The department will continue to liaise with other members of the legal and dispute solution sectors, meet, and is willing to listen to their views,” the spokesman said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021860/hong-kongs-justice-department-denies-prosecution-protesters
Hong Kong designer charged with rioting after being arrested during clash with police in Wong Tai Sin,"Li Chak-lam accused of being involved in clashes on Lung Cheung Road on Monday; Seven other defendants charged with range of offences, including possession of offensive weapons, obstructing police, and criminal damage","7:50pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Police said three of their officers needed medical treatment during the protests and violent clashes over the now-abandoned extradition bill in the past two months, after demonstrators pointed lasers at them.; “More than 1,000 protesters surrounded Sham Shui Po police station.

Li Chak-lam was brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates’ Courts to face one count of rioting, and another count of failure to provide proof of identity, during anti-government protests in Wong Tai Sin on Monday. The 32-year-old was one of eight defendants who appeared in court, charged with a range of offences in relation to the citywide chaos. Appearing alongside Li, was property agent So Kwong-tat, 38, who was charged with one count of possession of offensive weapons and one count of criminal damage, while cleaner Ho Eng-leng, 42, made his first appearance at Kowloon City Court, on one count of obstructing a public officer in Sham Shui Po. Protests intensified on Monday as those opposed to the government’s extradition bill surrounded police stations in eight districts in the latest show of defiance, and hurled objects, and at some, set fires. Police fired tear gas in response. The government has already abandoned the bill, which, if passed, would have allowed it to transfer fugitives in Hong Kong to jurisdictions the city does not have an extradition agreement with, including mainland China. But that is not enough for protesters, who want it withdrawn altogether and an independent inquiry into the alleged use of excessive force by police. The escalation in the scale of violence coincided with a citywide strike and acts of civil disobedience that jammed roads, obstructed rail lines, and saw hundreds of flights cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport. On Wednesday, the court in Kwun Tong heard that Li is accused of taking part in a riot on Lung Cheung Road, a major highway connecting central and east Kowloon. He was further accused of failing to produce his identity card at the police’s request. Li was allegedly seen throwing a helmet towards police lines, swinging an umbrella, and when tear gas was fired, Li is said to have attempted to throw it back at police. Standing quietly in the dock as he whispered his answers, Li had patches covering both cheeks and his right elbow bandaged. His barrister, Lawrence Lau Wai-chung, said the injuries occurred when Li was being arrested. The designer was released on HK$5,000 bail until his next hearing on October 2. He must report to police three times a week, and obey a curfew. So was intercepted at 8pm on Monday when he walked past Sau Mau Ping Disciplined Services Quarters in Kowloon district. He was found in possession of a black card knife, a silver multifunction knife, and one pair of scissors, the court heard. He was granted HK$2,000 bail, and has been barred from going within 100 metres of the building in question. At Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts, Ho was accused of obstructing police sergeant Fung Yiu-tung at the junction of Cheung Sha Wan Road and Yen Chow Street. He was granted HK$1,000 bail and ordered to observe a curfew until his next hearing on October 2. Five others were also charged at Eastern Court with damaging traffic lights in Tsuen Wan on Monday morning. But only three appeared in court, however, as two others remained in hospital with injuries sustained during their arrests, according to their lawyers. Self-employed woman Lau Gaai-lei, 32, mechanic Jose Louis Wong Wing-chun, 26, student Sin Tik, 22, and unemployed men Chan Cho-chak, 22, and Lo Wing-hang, 22, were all charged with criminal damage. Lau and Chan also faced an extra count of failing to provide proof of identity. While Chan and Lau were accused of damaging the green man sign of a pedestrian traffic light at the junction between Yeung Uk Road and Luen Yan Street, Wong, Lo and Sin allegedly vandalised another one that stood between Tai Ho Road and Sha Tsui Road. Lau and Sin did not attend court and will be brought to West Kowloon Court on August 9. Acting Chief Magistrate Peter Law Tak-chuen granted Wong, Chan and Lo HK$1,000 bail and ordered them to remain in Hong Kong, abide by a curfew, and report to the police regularly. Their case was adjourned to October 2 at West Kowloon Court after the prosecutor said they were brought to Eastern Court on Wednesday by a mistake.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021845/hong-kong-designer-charged-rioting-after-being
China’s envoys try to rally Europe to Beijing’s side on Hong Kong protests,"Ambassadors to Britain, the Netherlands and Spain call for condemnation of violence in the city","7:30pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Police said three of their officers needed medical treatment during the protests and violent clashes over the now-abandoned extradition bill in the past two months, after demonstrators pointed lasers at them.; “More than 1,000 protesters surrounded Sham Shui Po police station. They hurled bricks and glass bottles into the station and spray-painted on the outer walls, causing damage,” Tse said.; Upon learning some students were also the among hundreds gathered around the police station, Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong and his colleagues, who visited Fong in hospital earlier, went to the spot to persuade them to leave for safety reasons.","China is stepping up its attempts to rally global support for its handling of protests in Hong Kong, with its ambassadors in Europe calling for condemnation of the violence in the city. In a series of statements, Chinese envoys to Britain, the Netherlands and Spain have added their voices to a global campaign to promote Beijing’s line on the demonstrations. At an address on Tuesday at the London embassy to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to Britain, said ending violence in Hong Kong was a “top priority” for the city. Liu underlined Beijing’s support for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the city’s police force. He also praised members of the Chinese community in Britain who petitioned British politicians and raised public awareness “to deplore violence and oppose foreign interference” in Hong Kong. “You have demonstrated a strong sense of justice and responsibility and you have lived up to the Chinese national spirit,” he said. “I would like to reiterate that the top priority for Hong Kong now is to end violence, bring violent offenders to justice and restore order.” Several British politicians have spoken out about the protests, including former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt who warned China in June of consequences if the right to protest was neglected in Hong Kong. And last week, after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Thailand, Hunt’s successor, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, said “peaceful protest is a basic right and should be respected”. In the Netherlands, Chinese ambassador Xu Hong defended the efforts of Hong Kong’s leaders to pass a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed the city to send suspects to other jurisdictions, including mainland China. In an article published in Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad on Wednesday, Xu criticised “the United States and other countries” for failing to denounce violent protesters, and for “supporting troublemakers, [which] fuels the deterioration of the situation”. And in Spain, Chinese ambassador Lyu Fan took aim at Britain, saying “Hong Kong is no longer a colony under the orders of British politicians”. In an opinion piece published last month in Spanish newspaper ABC, Lu said that under “one country, two systems”, Hongkongers had a range of freedoms, including freedom of the press and speech and the right to strike. The latest comments followed strikes and demonstrations in Hong Kong on Monday, calling for the city’s legislature to scrap the extradition bill completely and launch an independent investigation into police violence against protesters. The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions estimated that around 350,000 workers took part in the strikes. China has used various tactics to try to drum up international support for its position on the protests. Last week state news agency Xinhua published a series of interviews with “foreign experts” critical of “irresponsible remarks” made by other countries about Hong Kong. The analysts from various countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Afghanistan, supported Beijing’s theory that violence was the result of “foreign forces” trying to undermine China’s sovereignty.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/diplomacy/article/3021835/chinas-envoys-try-rally-europe-beijings-side-hong-kong
Journalists union condemns attack on Hong Kong TV station vehicle by protesters during clashes at Wong Tai Sin,Hong Kong Journalists Association says work of frontline reporters should not be infringed and calls on protesters to refrain from violence; City’s largest television broadcaster TVB has been target of protesters’ anger over claims its reporting favours government,"6:38pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Police said three of their officers needed medical treatment during the protests and violent clashes over the now-abandoned extradition bill in the past two months, after demonstrators pointed lasers at them.; “More than 1,000 protesters surrounded Sham Shui Po police station. They hurled bricks and glass bottles into the station and spray-painted on the outer walls, causing damage,” Tse said.; Upon learning some students were also the among hundreds gathered around the police station, Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong and his colleagues, who visited Fong in hospital earlier, went to the spot to persuade them to leave for safety reasons.","The Hong Kong Journalists Association issued a statement on Wednesday condemning protesters who blocked and destroyed a news vehicle from the city’s largest television broadcaster on Monday in Wong Tai Sin. According to the statement, a TVB news van was blocked by protesters on Lung Cheung Road near Wong Tai Sin Centre in the early hours of Monday morning, near where tear gas rounds were fired by riot police against protesters during a protest. “The HKJA condemns such violent behaviour and demands the relevant individuals stop their violent action against journalists,” the association said. “The HKJA believes that every frontline journalist is sincerely carrying out his or her duties of reporting and exercising the role of the fourth estate, which should not be infringed.” TVB broadcast the obstruction and destruction in Wong Tai Sin. Dozens of protesters stood in front of the van refusing to let it pass. The television station reported that protesters hammered the van’s windows with blunt objects and tried to open the door of the vehicle. Some protesters also tried to jam traffic cones under the van. There have been a few similar cases, according to media reports. On Sunday night, protesters shattered the windows of a TVB van in Kwun Tong. A reporter and a photographer in the van were injured. TVB condemned the assault and destruction and urged the police to investigate. Since June, the Communications Authority has received more than 12,000 complaints about TVB’s news reports. In mid-July, during an extradition bill rally in Sha Tin, protesters attacked two journalists from the station, smashed the windscreens of two TVB vans and also stopped one of the vehicles from leaving the scene. The association also condemned the assault on TVB reporters while the Hong Kong News Executives’ Association also issued a condemnation on Monday, criticising all acts of violence against journalists. On Wednesday evening, TVB’s corporate communication department issued a statement about tightened security measures to reporters from other media in possession of long-term interview passes for TVB City, the station’s headquarters in Tseung Kwan O. Reporters would now be required to wear press passes in a noticeable place for identification when entering TVB City for interviews. The interview areas for reporters are restricted to areas including studios and canteens. Reporters have been asked not to enter offices on other buildings such as its news building, with the exception of the corporate communications department on the fifth floor at the administration building,",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021828/journalists-union-condemns-attack-hong-kong-tv-station
China troll army’s battle expeditions leap Great Firewall to target Hong Kong anti-government protests,Secretive Chinese nationalist group targets Hong Kong protesters and supporters on social media platforms banned on mainland,"6:17pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Police said three of their officers needed medical treatment during the protests and violent clashes over the now-abandoned extradition bill in the past two months, after demonstrators pointed lasers at them.; “More than 1,000 protesters surrounded Sham Shui Po police station. They hurled bricks and glass bottles into the station and spray-painted on the outer walls, causing damage,” Tse said.; Upon learning some students were also the among hundreds gathered around the police station, Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong and his colleagues, who visited Fong in hospital earlier, went to the spot to persuade them to leave for safety reasons.","A secretive Chinese nationalist group – best known for its internet trolling attacks – has stepped up its online information war in recent weeks, spreading pro-China memes and targeting supporters of Hong Kong’s anti-government protests in so-called “battle expeditions”. The state media-endorsed Diba forum’s latest targets have included high-profile Hong Kong figures such as Canto-pop singer Denise Ho Wan-sze, a vocal attendee of the protests, and pan-democrat lawmaker Claudia Mo Man-ching. Mo’s Facebook page was spammed with pictures of the Chinese flag on Monday, shortly after it was thrown into the harbour for the second time in three days by protesters. But they were eventually outnumbered by supporters of the protests, with many leaving comments remarking on the number of ﻿wumao – or “50 cent trolls” as they are known. Diba’s troll army is believed to be behind memes depicting hard hat-wearing protesters as cockroaches and zombies, as well as a lexicon of slurs such as “rubbish youth”, “yellow zombies” (yellow is the signature colour of the pro-democracy movement) and “LIHKG dogs”, the latter referring to the popular Reddit-like local forum used by protesters to coordinate and spread information. Diba’s modus operandi is also to cherry-pick and amplify social media content from Hong Kong voices speaking out against the protests, as well as highlighting reports of harassment towards Hong Kong police officers – including the leaking of their relatives’ personal details online – which is shared via Weibo to its estimated 20 million members for further dissemination. “You use memes to show off to your friends and chat up the opposite sex, but why don’t you use your knowledge and your memes to battle the rubbish youth of Hong Kong? Let them hear the sound of our anger,” said a post on Diba’s official Weibo social media account on Monday. Diba’s members operate across Facebook, Weibo and Tieba, the giant Chinese communication platform where the group began – originally for soccer fans – in 2004. Today, Diba boasts of conducting trolling campaigns with military precision, with users regularly leaping the Great Firewall to take part. The Facebook page of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), a Hong Kong NGO and protest organiser, was flooded with patriotic comments on 22 July, in what was believed to be a Diba-inspired attack, after anti-government protesters defaced the Chinese emblem outside the city’s central government liaison office. Some of the commenting accounts appear to be genuine, either based on the mainland or elsewhere, while others are “sock puppets” – social media accounts which have few or no followers and whose only purpose is to spread propaganda or anti-protester messages. Typical comments on the CHRF Facebook page included, “The rioters who hurt the motherland and Hong Kong must be fully condemned and severely punished with no excuse,” and “Behind these Hong Kong troublemakers are Western masters who pay. Their proposals and methods will not bring true freedom and democracy to Hong Kong, but only disaster and ruin!” Fang Kecheng, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has researched Chinese internet nationalism, believes the aggressive displays of patriotism on social media networks which are blocked in China are actually “not [about] winning hearts and minds overseas, but being applauded in mainland China”. “They boost Chinese nationalists’ pride and further dehumanise pro-democracy protesters. The dehumanisation of the enemy is important in military [campaigns], and is also seen as such in online ‘crusades’,” he said. Fang also pointed out that endorsement of Diba’s activities within China was limited to specific state media outlets, rather than any blanket approval. “The Communist Youth League might be endorsing such trolls, because promoting nationalism among young people is one of its major missions. [State newspaper] Global Times might be endorsing them, because they make money by selling nationalism,” Fang said. “But I think the CCP is also acutely aware that radical nationalists may go out of control and cause trouble. So the endorsement is specific to several organs rather than an overall strategy,” he said. Although Diba is not formally affiliated with the Communist Party, its stance on Chinese politics and international affairs closely echoes Beijing’s official line. Previous attacks targeted the Facebook pages of pro-Uygur rights groups in April, and independence-leaning Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen shortly after she was elected in 2016. Some of Diba’s efforts have backfired spectacularly, most recently in the battle expedition of July 22, which called on its members to flood the LIHKG forum in an attempt to disrupt the activities of Hong Kong protesters. A requirement for LIHKG users to register using a genuine IP address meant the trolls’ real identities and sensitive personal information were soon leaked by Hong Kong’s savvy online community. Diba’s online battles are not restricted to Hong Kong, as student activists in Australia and New Zealand have discovered. Serena Lee, at the University of Auckland, and Drew Pavlou, at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, have received online death threats – in what seems to be a coordinated effort – following their involvement in organising activities on campus in support of the Hong Kong protesters. “They seemed coordinated because they shared similar themes and insults,” Pavlou said. “The death threats have put [a] major strain on my family and personal relationships and made me fear participating in future activism.” The pro-Hong Kong democracy protest organised by Pavlou ended in a physical scuffle with Chinese nationalists. Since then, he said, he had been targeted with dozens of death threats across a variety of social media platforms. Hong Kong student activist Lee was allegedly shoved to the ground during a heated confrontation with three mainland Chinese students at the Auckland university’s Lennon Wall last Tuesday. Diba claimed in a Weibo post last Thursday that Lee had deliberately fallen to play the victim. She has since received multiple death threats from social accounts in New Zealand and abroad, according to the New Zealand Hong Konger Facebook group. A Diba spokesman refused a request for comment from the South China Morning Post.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/society/article/3021798/china-troll-armys-battle-expeditions-leap-great-firewall

Ireland, Japan, Britain and Singapore have all also issued similar travel warnings.; On Tuesday night, Hong Kong police clashed with about 100 protesters and residents in the working-class district of Sham Shui Po after a student union leader was detained for carrying laser pointers.; Keith Fong was held on the charge of possessing offensives weapons – namely 10 laser pens – but Hong Kong Baptist University’s Student Union accused the police of fabricating the charge in order to arrest people arbitrarily and called for his immediate release.; On Wednesday a message was circulating on the messaging app Telegram saying Fong’s arrest “precisely shows the power of the extradition bill … they can arrest you on a whim.”; As of Wednesday, the US state department and the Canadian government still had their alert set to “normal precautions,” for the city.; The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland Chinese courts. They have now broadened into a backlash against the government of the Asian financial hub, fuelled by many residents’ fears of eroding freedoms under the tightening control of China’s Communist Party leaders in Beijing.","Australia said the protests were expected to continue and had become more unpredictable, with the foreign affairs department strongly recommended staying away from large public gatherings, adding that the risk was greater at night and on weekends. Hong Kong is in its ninth week of consecutive mass protests, with police firing 800 canisters of tear gas during protests on Monday as they looked to clear demonstrators from at least seven districts across Hong Kong. On Tuesday, shops were closed in North Point from mid-afternoon after rumours circulated that busloads of people were coming from Fujian province in mainland China. Other reports suggested protesters would be going after the men in white who attacked them the previous night. More than 5 million people visited Hong Kong in June this year, of which roughly 80 per cent were from mainland China.

"Hong Kong facing ‘most serious situation’ since handover amid intensifying protests, says top Beijing official Zhang Xiaoming","Gravity of protest crisis laid out to hundreds of political and business leaders in candid address by head of China’s top government agency overseeing Hong Kong affairs; Zhang says protests are growing in size, reach and intensity as he seeks to rally support from influential figures at Shenzhen meeting","12:49pm, 7 Aug, 2019","Hong Kong faces its most serious threat since the city returned to Chinese sovereignty as the extradition bill saga intensifies, according to the head of China’s top government agency on Hong Kong affairs.; Telling guests he wanted to speak more frankly than spokespeople in his office, Zhang said the last seminar of this kind, jointly held by HKMAO and the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, was ahead of the Occupy movement in 2014, symbolising the significance of the gathering.; The meeting came on the back of the escalating political crisis, which brought three days of strike and protest chaos from Saturday to Monday, as well as further clashes between protesters and police on Tuesday, after eight consecutive weekends of unrest.","Zhang Xiaoming, director of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, warned a group of 500 political and business leaders in mainland China of the gravity of the protest crisis as it becomes “bigger and more violent”. Speaking in Shenzhen at the high-powered seminar on Wednesday, Zhang said Beijing was very concerned at Hong Kong’s “most serious situation” since 1997. “From June 9 until now, the extradition saga has lasted 60 days. It has grown bigger, with violent acts getting more intense, and wider sections of society being affected,” Zhang said, during the first five minutes of the event, when media were present. “We can say Hong Kong is facing the most serious situation since handover,” he added. “Therefore, this meeting is very important and special.” The seminar was held a day after the office staged a second press conference within two weeks on Hong Kong’s turmoil, the first such briefings held by HKMAO since Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China. “The biggest difference is that today’s seminar is convened when Hong Kong’s situation is very unstable,” he said. “Whenever any major political or legal issue arises in the implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ and the Basic Law, the central government would listen to your views and advice, and communicate, so that our decisions and policies can be more compatible with the actual situation in Hong Kong.” The Basic Law is the mini-constitution as agreed between Britain and China for post-handover Hong Kong. Zhang added: “The central government is highly concerned about the situation in Hong Kong, and have been making plans from a strategic level and with the full picture in mind.” The 500 guests included some 200 local deputies of the National People’s Congress, which is China’s top legislature, and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the country’s top advisory body. Also present were business leaders including chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce Aron Harilela, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Chief Executive Charles Li Xiaojia and Executive Council members Bernard Chan, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Tommy Cheung Yu-yan. Veterans from the pro-Beijing camp in Hong Kong, Elsie Leung Oi-sie, also the former secretary for justice, and Jasper Tsang Yok-sing, the former Legislative Council president, were also in attendance, as well as Deputy Director of HKMAO Huang Liuquan and the office’s spokeswoman Xu Luying. After the two-hour closed door speech from Zhang and the director of liaison office Wang Zhimin, the 500 guests were set to hold group discussions in the afternoon. It was expected that Zhang would rally support for embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the police force, in an attempt to silence dissent amid the political crisis, triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed for the transfer of fugitives to the mainland. Demonstrators have sought to highlight the five main demands of the anti-government movement, including the complete withdrawal of the bill and the establishment of an independent inquiry into police’s handling of protests.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021755/hong-kong-facing-most-serious-situation-handover-amid

NeoDemocrat lawmaker Gary Fan Kwok-wai also accused the government of fuelling the clashes between residents from both sides by branding the protests a separatist movement. He was speaking a day after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said in a press conference that the protesters were now calling for a revolution to liberate Hong Kong, which threatened national sovereignty. “All of this is trying to justify the violent crackdown by police,” he said. “The protesters’ attempts to besiege police stations or confront officers will definitely weaken the movement and even fall into the government’s trap.” Protesters in the movement, sparked by opposition to an extradition bill but which has broadened to encompass wider disaffection with the authorities, unleashed chaos across Hong Kong in an unprecedented citywide rampage on Monday. In addition to a mass strike, protesters besieged police stations in Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, Sha Tin, Tsim Sha Tsui, Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan, launching arson attacks at some of them. The leaderless movement has been mostly organised online, using the mobile messaging app Telegram and popular online forum LIHKG. Fan believed that another strike like Monday’s would work better than confrontations with police. IT lawmaker Charles Mok, of the Professionals Guild, agreed that besieging police stations was a dangerous move, saying it was important for the movement to maintain widespread support. “We should not fall into the trap of the local and central governments. They want to see this happen so we lose public support,” he said. Meanwhile, a local feminist who planned a peaceful demonstration in Tin Shui Wai found herself the target of accusations by online activists after dozens of protesters were arrested at the scene on Monday night. Petula Ho Sik-ying, social work professor at the University of Hong Kong and co-founder of online platform Gender and Sexual Justice in Action, called for a protest at 1pm on Monday against the arrest of a female protester who was photographed with her dress pulled up and underwear exposed when police dragged away, an act protesters called a sexual assault. Police later insisted officers had not behaved inappropriately, and blamed the woman for putting up a fight and resisting arrest. During the demonstration, a group of riot police suddenly charged into the crowd and start arresting the protesters outside station. An online post on LIHKG blamed Ho for telling protesters “to hold firm and stand there like a peaceful gathering, but she was later let go while protesters and citizens were arrested” – an accusation Ho rejected. Following the arrests, police fired rounds of tear gas at around 2:40pm to disperse the crowds. Protesters fled, with some throwing smoking canisters back towards police lines. The violent stand-off continued late into the night, with 82 protesters arrested. Ho rejected the accusation her appeal for a peaceful protest had led to the arrests. “I did not ask anyone to stand there and wait for the police to arrest them,” she said. “It was so sudden when the riot police rushed out to arrest the black-clad protesters, who had done nothing.” “To sit down [and remain peaceful] was the approach before the Umbrella Revolution. But now, am I crazy to ask the protesters to sit down?” she asked. “We can’t even escape from [the police]. How would I ask people to stay there to wait for the police to arrest them? We have to ‘be water’, meaning move around!” But since the online accusation, Ho was subjected to certain degree of harassment. On Tuesday, while she was having lunch in Jordan, she was approached and scolded by an unknown woman. After that, a photo of her was posted on Facebook exposing her location, with a message asking people to come and confront her. “I understand the frustration and anger of seeing so many people arrested in Tin Shui Wai. I also understand that people need an outlet to release their emotions, but they should not hunt me down,” Ho said.

Leung, now a vice-chairman of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, posted a message on his official Facebook page on Tuesday, calling on people to snub Wednesday’s flag day held by the Confederation of Trade Unions. But the confederation said the response to the fundraising event had been unexpectedly good, thanks to Leung’s “indirect promotion”. In a post on its Facebook page, the confederation thanked its volunteers and said the response to the flag day could probably be the best in 2019. A flag day is a government-approved event for non-profit groups to collect money on the streets, usually in return for stickers. Leung’s message read: “The [confederation] incited employees to go on strike for political purposes, breaking Hongkongers’ rice bowl. Please boycott. Please spread [the message].” The confederation, a key supporter of the strike, estimated about 350,000 residents took part. It was part of a broader anti-government campaign initially triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill. The strike started with a so-called “uncooperative campaign” on Monday morning that sabotaged Hong Kong’s transport infrastructure, clogging up traffic, causing flight cancellations and bringing most of the city’s MTR network to a standstill. The day ended with violent clashes between police and protesters across the city. Carol Ng Man-yee, the confederation’s chairwoman, rejected Leung’s accusations, and said Hongkongers “cannot be incited” to go on strike. “I would like to thank Leung for his care about the [confederation]. I hope he can donate to us too,” she said. “But we had explained quite clearly that employees would not be protected by law if they took part in the political strike. “In the past week, some young people went to MTR stations urging people to go on strike. So no one can be said to have been incited by us to take part.” Ng said the strike was initiated by online users. “They wanted the confederation to support them and as a progressive and independent labour union, how could we turn them down?” she said. A confederation executive committee member, Stanley Ho Wai-hong, who also helped appeal for donations around Choi Hung MTR station on Wednesday morning, said: “Thanks for the free promotion by our state leader. The response to the flag day was exceptionally good. “Many people gave HK$100 notes. Some told us that they would not have remembered it was our flag day but for Leung’s remarks.” He said he had not heard any reports of the group’s volunteers being harassed. Ng added she was a bit worried about their volunteers’ safety, as well as the amount of money that could be raised, after Leung’s call for a boycott. “Our volunteers will not force you to do anything. If you don’t agree with our cause, just ignore us,” she said. “But who knows, if more people donate after Leung’s call, we can only thank him again.” Ng said funds raised at Wednesday’s event would be used at an education fund to support unemployed workers, and a food bank for people in poverty. The confederation’s flag day will take place from 7am to 12.30pm on Wednesday, in various parts of Kowloon. Two other organisations are planning a flag day on the same day; the Taishan Charitable Association on Hong Kong Island and Wai Ji Christian Service in the New Territories.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/society/article/3021728/former-hong-kong-leader-leung-chun-ying-calls-boycott
Beijing expected to order Hong Kong’s pro-establishment politicians to toe line and throw their weight behind Carrie Lam and under-fire police force,Director of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to meet 200 local delegates in Shenzhen on Wednesday; Expectation is Zhang Xiaoming will lay down law in bid to silence dissent during ongoing political crisis,"8:00am, 7 Aug, 2019","She also noted the leaderless movement was different from the Occupy movement five years ago, which was mainly led by student leaders and scholars who advocated peaceful protest, asking the protesters not to be violent.","Beijing is expected to order Hong Kong’s pro-government camp to throw its weight behind embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the police force on Wednesday, in a bid to silence dissent among loyalists during the ongoing political crisis. Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, is set to meet some 200 local deputies of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in Shenzhen, just a day after his office arranged a second press conference on Hong Kong’s turmoil in two weeks. The director of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong, Wang Zhimin, is expected to join him. Wang met the same group of politicians, and representatives from major business chambers and community associations, in mid-June to show support for Lam. But the protests have escalated since then into an anti-government movement, with demonstrators insisting the government should withdraw the extradition bill, and set up an independent commission to inquire into the police’s handling of clashes with protesters. The extradition bill, which Lam declared was “dead” in July, would have allowed for the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city has no handover agreements, including mainland China. Although the Post reported that Beijing had been closely monitoring the social unrest in Hong Kong through a task force stationed in Shenzhen for nearly a month, it would be the first time Zhang speaks in public on the issue. The media would only be allowed to cover the five-minute opening of the closed-door meeting. “I believe the key message would be to rally support for Carrie Lam and the police. There are a number of enemies against Lam, even among the pro-establishment camp, and they want her to step down,” said Michael Tien Puk-sun, the delegate to the NPC. “Beijing would want to clear all the noise.” On Tuesday, the spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also stressed its resolute support for Lam, and said the opposition’s attempt to force her out was “doomed to fail”. Yet, Tien said there was a slight chance Beijing could announce something major during the meeting. “Under ‘one country, two systems’, it should be Lam that takes the lead and Beijing officials cooperating with her,” he said. Commentators expect the meeting to be a rallying call for the pro-Beijing camp to toe the line. “Some still suggest the government fully withdraw the bill and set up an independent inquiry committee,” said Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank. “But Beijing has characterised it as a national sovereignty issue. The camp has to be aware of that.” Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University, said it would be a rallying call for the “long-disappeared” pro-Beijing politicians, likely to be followed with a new round of propaganda in the city framing the movement as “pro-independence”. “But I don’t think it works this time, as millions took part in the earlier marches and are aware that is not about independence,” Ma said. With district council elections approaching, he questioned if pro-Beijing figures would be active in voicing support for the embattled government. On Tuesday, the HKMAO spokesman said the violent acts of protesters challenged the bottom line of the principle of one country, two systems. Tien, who went to the front line of the protests on Monday, had a different reading of the situation. “The small group of radicals leading the protests are pro-independence, but most following in behind are not,” Tien said. “Most are complaining to me about the poor performance of Lam’s government. What Beijing should do is to win back that majority of protesters.” Tien said he would like to convey his thoughts to Beijing if he could make it to the meeting on Wednesday.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021710/beijing-expected-order-hong-kongs-pro-establishment
"Help Hong Kong’s small traders weather political storm, government urged, as anger and clashes over extradition bill protests rumble on",Federation leader Simon Wong estimates shops and restaurants had takings halved during Monday’s strike and later clashes; He says he urged finance chief to help small-business owners weather the storm,"7:00am, 7 Aug, 2019","The city’s finance chief on Monday urged protesters to step back from their destabilising actions, warning the city’s economy could plunge into recession if it continued to be rocked by the US-China trade war and escalating turmoil on the streets.","Hong Kong’s small traders are taking a battering from the widespread political unrest and the government needs to step in and help, a business leader has said. Simon Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, estimated shops and restaurants had their business halved during Monday’s citywide strike and later clashes between protesters and police. Protesters expressed their anger across the city, starting with an organised campaign to grind the transport network to a halt during morning rush hour, before an afternoon of rallies. The day descended into the scenes of violence that have become a recurring part of the summer, with many police stations attacked. Wong said retail and dining had been hit hard by the day of turmoil, estimating the sectors had lost about 50 per cent of their daily take. Based on a government estimate of HK$35.2 billion (US$4.5 billion) for retail sales in June, 50 per cent of overall daily retail business would amount to about HK$586 million. “Generally speaking, many shops and restaurants opened late and closed earlier on Monday due to traffic chaos in the morning and the eruption of clashes in the afternoon in various districts. We believe both sectors lost about 50 per cent of business,” he said. “For the dining sector alone, we reckon it lost about HK$280 million.” He said a lot of shops closed very early on Monday out of concerns for their employees’ safety. “The whole town was very quiet, for example on the streets of Nathan Road in Mong Kok. At 7pm in the upmarket shopping mall Elements in West Kowloon, almost all the shops were closed. The whole town was like a dead city,” he said. Paul Chan Mo-po’s warning came as Hong Kong recorded economic growth of 0.6 per cent year on year for the second quarter of 2019. Chan said that, in quarter-to-quarter terms, GDP had decreased by 0.3 per cent, pointing out retail sales in June had already slumped by 6.7 per cent. Predicting retail sales could further plunge by 20 per cent as a lot of mainland Chinese tour groups cancelled visits out of safety concerns, Wong said he had met Chan two days earlier and urged him to introduce measures to help the city’s 340,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He did not go into details about the kind of help he wanted, saying that was a decision for Chan. “Most SMEs don’t want to get involved in this political dispute, but now this issue has affected the economy. There is not much we can do. I hope the government can understand our plight,” he said. Liberal Party lawmaker Peter Shiu Ka-fai, who represents the wholesale and retail sector, said Monday’s turmoil had hit every sector across Hong Kong hard. “Everybody in the retail sector holds a very dim view of the city’s outlook. They are all pessimistic. From what I’ve heard, the retail sales for luxury goods will drop by 30 per cent in July,” he said. He pointed out the escalating social unrest had deterred many from visiting the city – especially mainlanders – saying tourist spending had accounted for about a third of retail sales. “I hope the protesters calm down. If they use coercive methods to fight for their cause, they won’t win public recognition,” Shiu said. Henry Hui, a employee at a big pharmacy firm in Mong Kok, said his company’s business had dropped by 70 per cent on Monday. “After 4pm yesterday when clashes erupted in the district, we had only a few customers per hour. Normally we have about 600 to 1,000 customers per day,” he said. Miss Fung, manager of a jewellery shop in a Mong Kok mall, said she did virtually no business on Monday, as travel chaos made staff late and mall managers forced them to close at 3pm. However, she said the shop’s business had not been adversely affected over the past two months. “Our target customers are locals with spending power while mainland Chinese tourists only account for 20 to 30 per cent. Our business has been more or less the same over the past two months.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3021694/help-small-traders-weather-political-storm
"Hong Kong, mainland Chinese tensions flare again at New Zealand university",Rally in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong interrupted by Beijing supporter; Lennon Wall destroyed as differences deepen between the community,"5:00am, 7 Aug, 2019","The city’s finance chief on Monday urged protesters to step back from their destabilising actions, warning the city’s economy could plunge into recession if it continued to be rocked by the US-China trade war and escalating turmoil on the streets.","Tensions between different groups of New Zealand’s Chinese community flared again on Tuesday during a rally organised in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. About 100 people, including opposition MP David Seymour, attended the two-hour rally at the University of Auckland. The event was organised by students opposing the now-suspended extradition bill, legislation that would allow suspects of serious crimes to be sent from Hong Kong to other jurisdictions, including mainland China. The largely peaceful rally was briefly interrupted by an unidentified pro-Beijing supporter, who held up a placard that read: “Hong Kong independence mob”. He left after a confrontation with one of the rally-goers, which was filmed by other attendees. “I can feel there is increasing tension,” Serena Lee, from rally organiser the We Are Hong Konger group, said in a video of the event on the group’s Facebook page. “We’re actually opposing the extradition bill. But they [mainland students] see this as an action to oppose the Chinese government.” Lee declined an interview request from the South China Morning Post. This was the second confrontation at the university over the disturbances in Hong Kong. Last week mainland and Hong Kong students clashed over a “Lennon Wall” – a display of messages on Post-it notes that have been a feature of the protests in the city – as it was being set up on campus by Lee and fellow students. During the scuffle, Lee was allegedly pushed to the ground. On Tuesday the Lennon Wall at the university was destroyed again, according to the rally organisers. Lennon Walls and anti-extradition bill protests have been taking place on campuses in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. They have become flashpoints for a range of issues that have gone beyond the Hong Kong protests and included Beijing’s interference in local politics as well as Tibetan independence. Edric Liu, one of the mainland students involved in the confrontation with Lee, who is from Hong Kong, accused the rally organisers of using the event to promote separatism in a bid to divide the country. In a written interview with the Post he said attendees had been photographed holding a flag commonly known as the “free Tibet flag”. “This event is using the guise of a rally to promote separatism, deliberately tarnish the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, as well as Hong Kong police, and make excuses for the rioters’ mob behaviour,” he said. Liu said he and his two friends were cooperating with an investigation by the university into last week’s incident. The Chinese consulate in Auckland issued a statement supporting their actions, which prompted a letter from Seymour, who also addressed the rally on Tuesday. “The consulate general’s comments encouraged disruptive and violent behaviour which undermines authorities’ upholding the rule of law here in New Zealand, and therefore our internal affairs,” Seymour’s letter said. Local media reported on Wednesday that the New Zealand government had raised concerns with the Chinese embassy over a statement released by the consulate that supported the mainland students who started the confrontation, as well as other instances of Beijing interfering in local affairs. In response, an unnamed Chinese embassy diplomat told local media that the consulate statement had been misinterpreted and was asking students to express their views within the law and regulations. The government’s concerns were echoed by others in New Zealand’s Chinese community, who are now at the centre of Beijing’s efforts to increase its influence in New Zealand. Tze Ming Mok, a New Zealand researcher and writer on race relations, said the country’s Chinese community was diverse, with groups arriving at different times in its history. There was a divide over cultural differences between recent arrivals from mainland China and those who had been in the country longer, she said. Economic factors were also at play, according to Mok, who traces her own roots to Malaysia and Singapore. China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, with trading volumes reaching NZ$28 billion (US$18.3 billion) in 2018, according to the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Capital from mainland China had become a strong economic force that influenced the Chinese community in New Zealand, Mok said. Many in the community, as well as organisations, were reluctant to speak out on political or human rights issues as they were worried about repercussions, she said. “New Zealand is a small country, and its institutions tend to be vulnerable to large powers with deep pockets,” Mok said. “But what’s happening in Hong Kong, people see these protests … I think that has inspired a little bit more of bravery from the community.” Those who do speak out in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong have also faced online harassment, mostly from mainland Chinese internet trolls. The group of students at the University of Auckland who set up the Lennon Wall said they had been threatened and spammed online after speaking out about last week’s incident. Another Facebook page for Chinese people from Hong Kong in the country – called New Zealand Hong Konger – had received similar treatment, according to an administrator of the page who asked to remain anonymous because of safety fears. She provided screen captures of some of the messages, including ones that threatened violence and criticised those supporting the Hong Kong protesters as “America’s grandsons”, with the term “grandson” used in a derogatory way. “It is also interesting to see New Zealand-born Chinese remain publicly silent in this discussion, as they worry about the consequences they face,” she said. The administrator said New Zealand’s Hong Kong Chinese community was much smaller than the group from the mainland. “We need to work with other, non-Chinese groups, or we would be easily outnumbered in any quarrels or arguments like this,” she said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021698/hong-kong-mainland-chinese-tensions-flare-again-new-zealand
Baptist University president calls on Hong Kong police to treat students fairly after arrest over possession of laser pens triggers siege of Sham Shui Po Police Station,University’s president Roland Chin urges government and law enforcement authorities to respond positively to concerns; Police station siege triggered by student leader Keith Fong detained for carrying offensive weapons,"11:42pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"The head of a Hong Kong university on Wednesday urged authorities to treat students fairly and respond to widespread public concern after its student leader was arrested a day earlier for carrying laser pointers. The arrest of Baptist University’s student union president Keith Fong Chung-yin on Tuesday night drew more than 300 people to siege Sham Shui Po Police Station. They were later dispersed when tear gas was fired. In a letter to students, staff and alumni, the university’s president Roland Chin Tai-hong noted that besides Fong, another student was arrested near the police station on the same night. “We have spoken with Sham Shui Po police this morning and asked them to ensure our students are treated fairly,” Chin said. “We are also consulting legal experts and will continue to provide appropriate assistance to them.” Chin added university staff also checked on other students who were among those besieging the police station when tear gas was fired and tried to persuade them to leave for safety reasons. “The latest police actions have caused widespread public concern … I urge the government and law enforcement authorities to respond positively to these concerns,” Chin said. The force earlier said Fong had been found carrying offensive weapons, namely 10 laser pointers. Democratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun, on a radio programme on Wednesday, questioned whether there was enough evidence to arrest the student leader. “From a legal standpoint, it is an abuse of power,” To, who is also a lawyer by profession, said. “Unless say he was found with a piece of paper instructing him to buy laser pointers and aim them at police officers, how can you say there was a motive?” To, the deputy chairman of the Legislative Council’s panel of security, also accused police of double standards between last Tuesday’s incident and last month’s mob rampage in Yuen Long when protesters and bystanders were attacked at the railway station. Police, who turned up too late to stop the violence, have been accused of letting the perpetrators go, even though some were seen brandishing sticks and iron rods. Six men were arrested a day later. Meanwhile, protesters are hitting back at what they view as an abuse of powers by the police by calling on people to bring laser pointers for a stargazing session in Tsim Sha Tsui on Wednesday night. Messages circulating on social media platforms, including the encrypted LIHKG popular among the protesters, that university astronomy students and graduates had called for a gathering outside the Space Museum at 8pm. One of the messages said residents would be taught how to stargaze with laser pointers. It added that Wednesday night was the seventh day of the seventh month on the lunar calendar – a Chinese festival celebrating the annual meeting of a cowherd and weaver girl in mythology. According to folklore, the love between the two was not allowed and they were banished to opposite sides of the Silver River, symbolising the Milky Way. They could only meet once a year on the seventh night of July on lunar calendar when a flock of magpies would form a bridge to reunite the lovers. Shortly after midnight, residents and protesters were still out on the street, after the siege of the police station. Some protesters were seen remonstrating with police, and officers tackled at least a dozen of them to the ground. Fong, student union president at Baptist University, was arrested at the junction of Apliu Street and Kweilin Street, a few blocks from the police station. Soon after his arrest he was sent to the nearby Caritas Medical Centre as he complained of feeling unwell. Chief Inspector Chow Hok-yin from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said officers approached Fong because he was acting suspiciously, but he ran away. Officers gave chase and caught him, and found 10 torch-like laser pointers, each 18cm (7 inches) long, in his plastic bag. The pointers – which a police source said were strong enough to burn paper – are regularly seen being aimed at officers during clashes and stand-offs with protesters. Asked why a laser pointer could be treated as an offensive weapon, Chow said: “If anyone uses such an object to attack a person, it could also be deemed an offensive weapon. “In recent operations, you can also see people flashing such laser pointers at police officers. Some of us have felt unwell, while some were even injured.” The student union first confirmed the arrest on social media in the evening and condemned police for, as the union saw it, abusing their power. After visiting Fong in hospital, Chin said the student was in a good condition both physically and emotionally. Fong was waiting to see a doctor and had not given police a statement, Chin continued, adding that three lawyers were at the scene to help him.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021716/tear-gas-fired-sham-shui-po-hong-kong-after-students
"Defend your home against radical protesters, Beijing urges Hongkongers amid ongoing extradition bill unrest","China’s top agency overseeing city affairs warns against angry youth going too far, but also appeals for peace; Says local officials and police capable of restoring order","11:35pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"China’s top government agency overseeing Hong Kong affairs has made clear it will be up to the city itself to restore law and order upended by two months of anti-government protests, and appealed to citizens to stand up against radical protesters to defend their home or face the consequences of endless violence and chaos. In another rare media briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, following a day of unprecedented mayhem across the city unleashed by radical protesters attacking police stations and blocking roads, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) appealed to the city’s angry youth in particular for peace, but also warned them against going too far. “We would like to make it clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: those who play with fire will perish by it. And at the end of the day, they will eventually be punished,” HKMAO spokesman Yang Guang said. He warned that the central government would not tolerate any attempt to separate the city from China, as Hong Kong’s future was in the hands of 1.4 billion Chinese people, including 7 million Hongkongers. Yang also made it clear the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would not look on if Hong Kong’s protest crisis escalated beyond the local government’s control, even though Beijing was firmly behind Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s embattled administration and the city’s police, and was confident they were fully capable of restoring public order. Asked about the possibility of a military crackdown, Yang replied: “The central government will absolutely not allow a disturbance that the Hong Kong government cannot control to appear in Hong Kong and threaten national unity or security. “But the city’s government and police are completely capable of crushing violent crimes, and restoring order and peace.” A report by the official Xinhua news agency on the press conference made no mention of the PLA. Office spokeswoman Xu Luying hit out at radical protesters for challenging national sovereignty and calling for a revolution to “liberate” Hong Kong. Xu appealed to the younger generation, assuring them that Beijing understood their grievances, but also insisted the violence and lawlessness they were engaged in had to end, and that they needed to understand their country better. She lamented that young Hongkongers lacked a sense of national identity, and were being misled by radical activists who were colluding with foreign forces to cause trouble in the city. The HKMAO’s media session came a week after its first press conference on the city’s affairs since the 1997 handover of sovereignty. It was also held on the eve of a high-profile seminar in Shenzhen, at which top Beijing officials were expected to weigh in on the crisis gripping Hong Kong. Some commentators raised concerns that Beijing’s appeal to the general public to defend their home could encourage clashes with protesters, but others found it appropriate as the protests were now being seen as challenging national sovereignty. Yang stressed that as radical protesters were pushing Hong Kong into “a dangerous abyss”, Hongkongers’ immediate task was to stop the violence, and restore order. “Now is the crucial moment for us to stand firm and guard our beautiful homeland,” he said. Referring specifically to reports about ordinary citizens disagreeing with protesters’ actions, Yang said: “Let’s follow the example of the grey-haired old man who resolutely refused to accept the demonstrators’ leaflets at the airport﻿, to reject ignorance … “Let’s do as the hurried commuters who confronted those saboteurs who held open train doors and tried to stop trains from running.” He went on to ask: “Who will suffer if the situation becomes irremediable? And who will benefit in the end?” On Hong Kong’s youth problems, Xu lamented that many youngsters were caught up in the protests because the city’s national education system was problematic, and they lacked a sense of national identity. “The central government has always been concerned about young Hong Kong people’s growth. We know clearly that they face a lot of difficulties and confusion, and we feel for them. But these problems cannot be solved with violence,” she said. “If these young people come out and look at the mainland and the world, they will know that our country is in an era of prosperity.” Xu also criticised protesters for removing a Chinese flag flying in Tsim Sha Tsui and throwing it into the harbour, but noted that pro-Beijing groups had hoisted it again. “The people who love the country and love Hong Kong are not alone. They are backed by 1.4 billion Chinese people,” she said. “We strongly condemn this kind of destructive act as the price would be the stable lives of 7 million Hongkongers, as well as the city’s prosperity, stability and future.” Yang also highlighted the popular protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, as evidence that radicals were challenging the “one country, two systems” policy that allows greater freedoms in Hong Kong than the rest of China. “What is Hong Kong? It’s a special administrative region of China. What do you want to liberate, and where do you want to take the city through liberation?” he said. “The fate of Hong Kong will be decided by all Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots.” Opposition lawmaker Helena Wong Pik-wan of the Democratic Party said she feared Beijing had misjudged the situation and added fuel to the fire. “We are not challenging national sovereignty,” she said. But Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think thank, said: “The central government needs to weigh in when the city’s internal conflict has evolved into an attack on Beijing.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021715/defend-your-home-against-radical-protesters-beijing-urges
Rumours of armed gangs heighten North Point tensions after anti-government protesters’ fight with mob,Anti-government protesters clashed with men wielding sticks on Monday night; Unsubstantiated reports of Fujianese reinforcements coming to settle scores in the area prompt businesses to shut up shop early,"10:53pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"More than half the businesses in the main shopping area of North Point were shuttered on Tuesday afternoon after rumours that protesters and armed gangs were out to settle scores after a fierce skirmish a day earlier. From about 2pm on Tuesday, businesses on King’s Road near Ming Yuen Western Street, where the brawl occurred on Monday night, began closing, even though they would usually be open for about seven hours more. Metropole Department Store, one of the largest shopping centres in the area, closed just after 2pm. “Because of an air conditioning problem, we stopped working today,” the mall’s hotline said. Banks, supermarkets, restaurants and Cantonese opera venue the Sunbeam Theatre all closed about 4pm. Simon Kwok, who runs a newspaper stand, closed his shop at 3pm, four hours earlier than usual. The shopkeeper, who is in his 50s and has had the stand for decades, said he heard from fellow stallholders there would be clashes between protesters and local residents. “Most shops nearby are either already closed or preparing to close earlier than usual,” he said, adding he heard rumours Fujianese people living nearby were preparing knives and other weapons to fight anti-government protesters if they came to the neighbourhood. The demonstrators fought with staff-wielding attackers on Monday, during a citywide strike which ended in road occupations and clashes with police. “There will be no business anyway because of the protests,” Kwok said. Amid a stream of rumours and fake news flying around online, the threat about looming violence in the area spread quickly online and through WhatsApp groups. A person who claimed to be from a Fujianese family, but on the side of protesters, wrote a popular post on online forum LIHKG urging people not to go to North Point to fight. According to conversations in chat groups set up on WeChat by Fujianese in Hong Kong and mainland China, people from the province were being mobilised to take revenge for the clash on Monday night. “At least five buses of Fujianese have already left for Hong Kong,” claimed one message seen by the Post. But it was uncertain whether and when they arrived. In a video clip circulating on social media, a speaker says: “We Fujian people should go [to Hong Kong] to fight back!” On Monday night around 8pm, about 10 people with poles fought with protesters on King’s Road in North Point. They were seen running along the nearby Ming Yuen Western Street, some darting into the office of a group called the Hong Kong First Youth Association. Dozens of protesters chased after them until they reached the building, smashing the windows of the office as they asked for the men to be handed over. A man inside a flat in the building took out a knife and shouted at the protesters outside. About six people originally from Fujian province were at the association when the Post visited on Tuesday afternoon. Three of them said they lived and worked in Hong Kong but were not members of the association. “We came to help when we heard that the association’s windows were smashed,” said one man, who refused to give his name. A middle-aged man who gave his surname as Wong said seven men from Fujian ran into the building on Monday evening and they let three people stay inside the office. “A lot of people from Fujian live in this area,” he said. “We don’t know these people. But we let them in because they were injured and bleeding.” The man said the protesters shouted insults about Fujianese people, which sparked people’s anger. On Tuesday, at about 6pm, more than 20 people gathered at the roadside of Ming Yuen Western Street. Two police cars arrived on King’s Road before 4pm. By 6pm, a dozen officers were seen near North Point MTR station. A staff member from Hong-kin for Golden Aged Citizens, a facility home to 30 elderly people on North Point Road, said they received a call from police at about 9am on Tuesday asking them to close all windows and keep residents inside. “The police didn’t mention anything about a clash or violence,” the worker said. At 8.30pm, dozens of people gathered in front of the mall and near the footbridge on King's Road facing Ming Yuen Western Street, some chatting in Mandarin and Min, a dialect common in Fujian province. A man among the group told the Post he arrived in the city on Tuesday, but refused to say where he was from and why he came. A woman said she was a local resident. “I’m just enjoying the cool air,” she said, refusing to comment further. At 9pm, more than a dozen police officers went to the association office. They took away some objects wrapped in tarpaulin as evidence and put them in a truck. One police officer said no arrests were made and did not comment on what evidence they took away. Pole-shaped objects could be seen among the evidence. The police left after 10 minutes. Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung from the force’s public relations office said emergency calls on Monday were received shortly after 7pm, but officers could only arrive on the scene to handle the attack at 11pm as North Point Police Station was besieged by a large group of violent protesters. “When officers wanted to leaveand head to the scene to handle the situation, we were attacked by the protesters. Therefore we could not deploy officers in an appropriate time,” Kong said. Asked why no officers were patrolling the streets, Kong said: “The services of 21 police stations were affected by violent protesters on Monday. You have to be fair. We deployed quite a number of officers to handle violent incidents, which inevitably affected our service to emergency calls.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/society/article/3021708/rumours-armed-gangs-heighten-north-point-tensions-after-anti
"Police fired nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition during chaos that gripped Hong Kong, almost equalling amount used in June and July clashes","Officers used more than 800 rounds of tear gas, 140 rubber bullets and 20 sponge-tipped rounds on Monday; Protests have escalated into attempt to destroy city say police, echoing comments made by city’s leader Carrie Lam","10:20pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"Hong Kong police fired nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition during the chaos that gripped the city on Monday, almost equalling the total amount used over the past two months. Revealing the figures on Tuesday, police said protests had escalated into an organised attempt to destroy the city, echoing comments made by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in her Monday press conference. Officers also arrested 148 people, 95 men and 53 women, during the protests on Monday for various crimes including unlawful assembly and assaulting police officers, with the youngest aged only 13. After calling a citywide strike aimed at crippling traffic and business on Monday, protesters gathered on the streets and besieged police stations in at least 10 districts throughout the day. They were seen setting fires, and throwing bricks, stones and petrol bombs at police stations. One police vehicle parked inside a complex was hit by a petrol bomb and set on fire. Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung, of the police public relations bureau, said a total of 21 police stations had been vandalised by protesters. He said officers fired more than 800 rounds of tear gas, 140 rubber bullets, and 20 sponge-tipped rounds in at least 10 areas, including Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui and Wong Tai Sin. In June and July police fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas, 160 rubber bullets, and 150 sponge-tipped rounds. “We saw a practical need on this. The violence, its frequency and extensiveness has been escalating,” Kong said. “The number of violent incidents on Monday exceeded those that took place in the whole of June.” He added that seven officers had been injured as protesters threw bricks and shot metal balls with catapults. Police also deployed two purpose-built anti-riot armoured vehicles for the time on Monday to handle conflicts in Mong Kok. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog U5000 armoured vehicles, bought in 2010, were equipped with a powerful sonic capability and the exterior could be electrified to shock anyone who touched it. Kong said the trucks were a defensive tool used to transport officers, gear, and remove obstacles from roads. Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung said the initial peaceful protests had evolved into “organised events to destroy Hong Kong”. He said reasonable force was needed to restore law and order across the city, and dismissed claims officers had taken out their anger on protesters and reporters by using excessive force to subdue them. “It takes two to tango. Both police and public had a role to play in restoring Hong Kong safety and stability,” he said, when asked how officers could still function if Hongkongers saw them as the enemy. “Definitely our officers could not show the temper of the rioters,” he said. “In fact, we take care of their behaviour. We have psychologist talk with them whenever they are not working, to make sure they are calm enough to carry out their duties.” He said a small number of officers had been removed from the front line after being verbally and physically abused during clashes between police and members of the public. Tse also apologised to the media if any reporters had been injured in recent protests. Before the press conference began, an executive committee member of Hong Kong Journalists Association read out a statement condemning police for abuse power and mistreating reporters. At a separate press conference on Tuesday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the government’s top task was to restore harmony in the city. “The pressing issue is to restore law and order,” he said. “We must have law and order before we can look at how Hong Kong should move forward.” Security minister John Lee Ka-chiu called for protesters to stop using violence. “If the police are not attacked, or if any public meetings are orderly and peaceful, then there is actually no need for police to take any enforcement action,” Lee said. Lee also called the recent protests the “most widespread, most damaging and most serious” since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997. Cheng Sui-on, who leads the Fire Services Department, said firefighters were dispatched to 21 cases of arson on Monday, and urged protesters to stop starting fires. Candy Kwok Wai-ying, assistant commissioner of transport, said 200 sets of traffic lights were damaged, with more than 70 still out of service on Tuesday. Kwok said the outages were concentrated on main roads in various areas, such as Hennessy Road, Nathan Road, and the Tsuen Wan section of Castle Peak Road. Workers had been sent to fix the lights, Kwok said, and urged motorists to be careful. Denise Chan, a secretary in her 30s who was on her day off, had been in Admiralty and Causeway Bay to run errands and said traffic in both places remained orderly, despite the lack of traffic lights. “I think Hongkongers are quite disciplined, and the drivers will slow down anyway, so it really isn’t that big a problem,” she said. Meanwhile, in a joint statement on Tuesday, Civil Rights Observer, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, and Amnesty International Hong Kong, urged police not to deploy water cannon trucks or armoured vehicles against protesters. They said the public were unfamiliar with the new weapons and it could further intensify emotions. The groups also accused the police of abusing the use of tear gas, and said officers should not actively attack protesters, and should also consider the impact on the neighbourhood. On protest violence, Civil Rights Observer spokesman Wong Ho yin said: “It is caught in a vicious circle, because the government didn’t heed their views, but sends police to suppress them. “Then the protesters step up action and then the police use more force. The police should exercise restraint in the first place.” Additional reporting by Zoe Low and Ng Kang-chung",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021703/police-fired-nearly-1000-rounds-ammunition-during
Beijing supporters in Hong Kong vow to protect national flag after anti-government protesters throw one into harbour twice in three days,"Tuen Mun district councillor co-organised one set of volunteer guards and says there are at least three groups; Desecrating national flag illegal and punishable by a fine of US$6,383 and three years in jail","8:56pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"Pro-Beijing groups have vowed to protect the Chinese national flag in Hong Kong as Beijing mobilises its supporters in the city to counter anti-government protests. Tuen Mun district councillor Leo Chan Manwell, who is a member of the Beijing-loyalist Federation of Trade Unions, has co-organised one set of volunteers and the 40-year-old said there were at least three groups of voluntary guards. This came after the Chinese flag outside the Harbour City shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui was removed from a flagpole and thrown into the sea on Saturday, after tens of thousands of people defied a police ban and marched to the area following a rally in Tai Kok Tsui. Chan said the first group of guards brought a Chinese flag with them, and raised it on Saturday night. After the flag was removed at around 7pm on Monday and again thrown into the harbour, another group went there a few hours later with their own Chinese flag and raised it. Chan’s group then gathered under the flagpole at about 7am on Tuesday, and sang the national anthem. He said about 70 people attended the gathering. “We are not highly organised, we are just a group of people who wanted to go,” he said. “We understand that some people are unhappy with how the city’s government pushed forward the extradition bill, but that has nothing to do with the national emblem or the national flag.” Chan said while his group was not involved in the voluntary flag-raising of the past few days, they would hold one of their own if protesters removed the Chinese flag in Tsim Sha Tsui, or in other locations, in the future. “Guarding and respecting the national flag is the responsibility of every Chinese citizen,” he said. But Chan also said the Harbour City shopping centre, or the Home Affairs Department, should do more to stop people from removing flags. Wharf Properties confirmed it was responsible for the “management” of the flagpole at its Harbour City development, and would devote resources to protecting it, but declined to specify what those resources would be. Anti-government protests first broke out in Hong Kong in June over a controversial extradition bill. After the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced on July 9 the bill was “dead”, the protests evolved to express young demonstrators’ frustration over Beijing’s policy for their city. On July 21, protesters defaced the national emblem outside Beijing’s liaison office in the city. The act was strongly criticised by Lam, the liaison office and Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO). Lam and Beijing’s two offices also condemned protesters who threw the flag into the harbour. In a press conference on Tuesday, HKMAO spokeswoman Xu Luying criticised protesters for throwing the flag into the harbour, and noted pro-Beijing groups in Hong Kong had raised it again. “The people who ‘love the country and love Hong Kong’ are not alone. They are backed by 1.4 billion Chinese people,” she said. Former chief executive Leung Chun-ying, a vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), also said on Facebook he would offer HK$1 million (US$127,600) to anyone who could provide information about the act, so the person responsible could be brought to justice. Under Hong Kong law, a person who publicly and wilfully desecrates the national flag can be fined up to HK$50,000 or jailed for three years. In 2016, pro-establishment lawmakers placed miniature Chinese and Hong Kong flags on their desks in a Legislative Council meeting, and localist lawmaker Cheng Chung-tai upended the flags during a break. Cheng was found guilty of desecrating the flags and was fined HK$5,000 in 2017.

Beijing appeals to Hong Kong public to help restore order in the city,State media urge ‘people who love’ the city to stand with its embattled police and administration,"6:15pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"Beijing is trying to rally the Hong Kong public to help restore the city’s social order, in its latest strategy to find an end to the anti-government unrest engulfing the city this summer. Top Communist Party mouthpieces issued new commentaries on Tuesday after defiant protesters unleashed chaos across the city on Monday, and workers in various sectors took part in a general strike. An opinion piece carried by state news agency Xinhua said Hong Kong could not bear more chaos and violence that threaten “unthinkable consequences”. “Everyone [in Hong Kong] needs to pause and think about whether Hong Kong can withstand any more suffering, chaos and sacrifice of the public interest. [They] should not be held hostage, nor tolerate violence and swallow the bitter fruit of social chaos,” the commentary said. “Let’s all take a stand to say no to violence and bring Hong Kong back to reason and peace, rather than the path of no return.” In a front-page staff commentary, Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily said the central government “resolutely support actions to safeguard Hong Kong’s law and order by patriots and people who love Hong Kong”. “If Hong Kong’s chaos continues, the whole society will end up footing the bill,” it said. “At present, the greatest danger for Hong Kong’s situation is that the violent actions have yet to be effectively stopped … We trust … that with unity between the patriots and people who love Hong Kong, Hong Kong society can restore law and order soon.” The People’s Daily commentary underlined Beijing’s support for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, and called on the public to stand with Lam and Hong Kong police. To rally support for the beleaguered Hong Kong government, Beijing has also summoned the city’s top political advisers – members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – and national lawmakers to the neighbouring city of Shenzhen for a crisis meeting on Wednesday. During Monday’s strike, transport services and daily business were severely disrupted, and clashes erupted between protesters and some opposing members of the public. Beijing-based political analyst Zhang Lifan said Beijing would use such divisions against the protesters by using propaganda to unite the patriotic camps and Hong Kong public who wanted to move on from the violence. “This is a great opportunity for Beijing to play counteroffensive,” Zhang said. Li Xiaobing, associate professor of law at Nankai University in Tianjin, said the state media commentaries were also calling on Hong Kong to draw on its own resources to restore order and heal the rifts. “The worst strategy for the [Hong Kong] government is to fight alone,” Li said. “Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures.” Additional reporting by Echo Xie",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3021649/beijing-appeals-hong-kong-public-help-restore-order-city
Group of extradition bill protesters hold first press conference to counter Hong Kong government line on recent demonstrations,"Two men and one woman give conference in Mong Kok, dressed in masks and helmets; Trio call on government ‘not to waste public resources’ by holding daily press conferences, and stress they are not representatives of protest movement","4:37pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"A group of young people supporting the anti-government protests which have shaken Hong Kong held its first press conference on Tuesday to counter the administration’s line on the unrest, but refused to be identified as the movement’s representatives. The address followed Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s announcement on Monday that the police would hold daily briefings on the extradition bill protests and that government departments would also give their own conferences when necessary. At the Tuesday event, held at a private location in Mong Kok, the three speakers gave their names as Mary, Linus and Jerry. The trio were aged 18 to 32 and only Jerry gave his occupation – student. Dressed in black and wearing masks and helmets, the three said they had organised online, using the mobile messaging app Telegram. They said they were not representatives of the movement, which has been mobilised online, and which lacks identifiable leaders. The protests – which were sparked by opposition to an extradition bill but have broadened to encompass wider disaffection with the authorities – have been joined by thousands of young protesters, many of them clad in trademark masks and black T-shirts. An announcement about the press conference was also posted on the online forum LIHKG – popular with protesters – on Monday night. In a statement released by the group, it said speakers decided to remain anonymous “for fear of prosecution”. “We make an urgent call for the government to not waste further public resources by holding daily press conferences,” Jerry said. “The public seeks the government’s direct response to the five major demands.” He was referring to the movement’s call for the government to fully withdraw the now-shelved extradition bill, launch an independent inquiry into the police’s use of force, reform the chief executive and Legislative Council elections, grant amnesty to all arrested protesters and retract the riot categorisation of extradition bill protests. He also said protesters would not be placated should the government respond only to some of the demands. The group’s statement said the press conference was not affiliated with any political party, or with any organisation leading the movement. The aim of the press conference, which in future would feature members of the public, was to “act as a counterweight to the government’s monopoly on political discourse”. While Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the protests had taken a toll on Hong Kong’s economy due to shops and restaurants being forced to close, the group argued this was not the case. “Rather, the impact of the global economy on the trading and logistics industry should be the major cause for the slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter,” it said. When asked how representative they were of those taking part in the protest movement, Jerry said: “We merely act as a platform for the people to show their voices.” Mary disclosed that more than 100 activists mobilised online were involved in drafting the statement. Asked if protesters’ actions had become too radical, Mary said: “Those are the actions of some protesters. We have no means to collect views and generate a stance now.” In recent protests, police stations were vandalised, with graffiti sprayed on walls and facilities damaged by bricks and other missiles. Meanwhile, Jerry said protesters would not confront the Chinese army directly, should the People’s Liberation Army’s Hong Kong garrison get involved in future protests. “We will go home and sleep,” he said. He also said eight extradition bill rallies that accompanied a mass strike on Monday had attracted about 300,000 people in total. A long-time LIHKG user who wished to remain anonymous said the civilian press conference should be a means to help the wider public understand protesters’ thinking. “I think the press conference’s target audience was [the movement’s] supporters, and did not attack the opposition’s position,” he said. He added that the speakers could better explain the movement’s position on pushing for the five demands, and why protesters would be unwilling to give up any of them.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021626/group-extradition-bill-protesters-hold-first-press
"Hong Kong protests: two charged with damaging traffic light, while four accused of possessing weapons in Yuen Long are bailed","Traffic light pair bailed as court adjourns case to September 17; Those charged with weapon offences initially denied bail, but High Court approves temporary release with conditions","3:45pm, 6 Aug, 2019",There was also a message on LIHKG calling on people to buy a laser pointer and surrender themselves to police.,"Two men were brought to a Hong Kong court on Tuesday charged with damaging a traffic light, a day after anti-government protesters brought the city’s traffic to a near standstill. Construction worker Sun Wai-lam, 27, and designer Wong Yun-kei, 30, faced a joint count of criminal damage at Sha Tin Court. They are accused of damaging the cables of a traffic light at the junction of Lion Rock Tunnel Road and Tai Po Road in Sha Tin on Monday. The traffic device was a government property, a court filing said. A witness alleged that Sun and Wong cut the cables early on Monday morning. As charges were read against them on Tuesday, the two, clad in green T-shirts, replied from the dock: “I understand.” Prosecutors asked for the case to be adjourned until next month as more time was needed to investigate. Acting Principal Magistrate Ko Wai-hung adjourned the case until September 17 and granted them bail. He ordered them to pay a cash bail of HK$3,000 (US$383), surrender their travel documents, report to a police station regularly and observe a curfew. Separately, four men previously denied bail after they were accused of possessing offensive weapons during a protest in Yuen Long last month were released on the condition they pay up to HK$100,000 (US$12,800). At the High Court, Mr Justice Andrew Chan Hing-wai on Tuesday granted bail to cook Vincent Chu Chun-hoi, 18, clerk Chu Tsz-wan, 23, and students Liu Hui-fung, 19, and Yung Wai-shing, 25, with conditions. They were charged in relation to the protest in Yuen Long on July 27. Chu, Liu and Yung were ordered to pay a cash bail of HK$20,000, while Vincent, the youngest who was said to be found with most weapons, had to fork out five times that much. The quartet must report to a police station and abide by a curfew before they appear at the Fanling Court, which had earlier rejected their bail, on September 3. Four others, who could not appear in court on Monday as they were still in hospital, also made their appearances at Kowloon City and Kwun Tong Court on Tuesday. Student Chan Chun-ting, 18, and clerk So Ching-yee, 22, were charged with unlawful assembly on Nathan Road in Mong Kok on August 3. Chan’s lawyer complained police had used excessive force to subdue his client. Meanwhile, transport worker Tsang Tin-lok, 22, and baker Aidan Tam Ho-yu, 24, both faced a charge of assaulting a police officer during a protest in Wong Tai Sin on August 3. Tsang complained he was forced to make an involuntary witness statement, while Tam claimed police officers assaulted him. All the four were granted bail, as were 11 others who appeared in court on Monday.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021611/hong-kong-protests-four-men-accused-possessing-weapons

The drill was part of security preparations for the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, Shenzhen police said on the force’s Weibo newsfeed. “A drill will be held to increase troop morale, practise and prepare for the security of celebrations [and] maintain national political security and social stability,” police said. In live videos of the police drills shown on the Yizhibo network, officers in body armour, helmets and shields confronted groups of people in black shirts and red or yellow construction safety helmets – similar to those worn by Hong Kong protesters – who were holding flags, banners, batons and wooden boards. One of the banners read “return my hard-earned money” – a slogan often used by migrant workers in protest against unpaid salaries. “The practice is complete with mature anti-mob tactics. The police forces can present an anti-mob formation, which is flexible, suitable for different situations, with accurate aim and effective control,” a narrator said during the live broadcast. As the drill escalated and more “rioters” were deployed, police fired tear gas and smoke covered the training ground. A few minutes later, the rioters fired home-made gas bombs then set bogies alight and drove them at the police lines. The officers changed formations and pressed the rioters, making arrests. Police handlers and their dogs were also on the scene. Other drills included anti-smuggling and search-and-rescue exercises involving personnel from the People’s Liberation Army. The drill was presented as preparation for the 70th anniversary celebrations but it came amid continued violence in the streets of Hong Kong and two incidents of the Chinese national flag being thrown into Victoria Harbour. Hong Kong has been engulfed for two months in turmoil stemming from opposition to the now-suspended extradition bill. “Is this hinting at Hong Kong?” asked a commenter on the Shenzhen police thread on Weibo. “We are doing drills today, and they can enter into real practice in Hong Kong in the future. We can send thousands of anti-mob squads over and strike hard at the radical traitors, those Hong Kong independence supporters,” another user said. Since protests escalated in Hong Kong, Beijing has reiterated its “unflagging support” for embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her administration to take lawful action to restore order, and warned that the city was entering “a most dangerous phase” with violence on the streets.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/military/article/3021597/chinese-police-mass-12000-anti-riot-officers-shenzhen-drill

Sign up here. Follow STYLE on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter","As most people keeping an eye on the news will know, Canto-pop singer Denise Ho Wan-sze is one of the most high-profile show business celebrities to support the demonstrations. Ho addressed the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last month to call on it to remove China from the body and convene an urgent session to protect Hongkongers.  Ho’s social media posts (IG:@hoccgoomusic) consist predominantly of messages in support of the anti-extradition bill protests and her sentiments have been quoted by international media outlets including CNN and France 24. The singer was also an active advocate during the 2014 sit-in street protests in the city known as the “Umbrella Movement” and was arrested in December of that year for taking part in the pro-democracy movement.  Another Hong Kong singer-songwriter Anthony Wong Yiu-ming also took part in the protests last month. Other celebrity protesters include actor Gregory Wong Chung-yiu and singer-actress Deanie Ip Tak-han. Actor and filmmaker Chapman To expressed his opposition to the extradition bill in an episode of his talk show, Chapman To’s Lateshow, on Facebook. One of the commentary videos on his webpage, which has amassed more than 811,000 followers, focused on the run-in between a mob of men dressed in white-shirted and black-shirted protesters in Yuen Long on July 21, and has been shared more than 5,000 times. While some celebrities may be openly supporting the anti-extradition bill protests, many have remained silent, perhaps fearing political repercussions. Ho, for example, has been cut off from the lucrative Chinese market. Others perhaps fear a backlash from fans. Hong Kong actress Charmaine Sheh Sze-man, who has a large mainland Chinese fan base, was widely criticised online after “liking” an Instagram post showing the anti-extradition protests. Hong Kong-born actor Jackie Chan, who was in Taiwan on June 11 to promote his new album, expressed ignorance over the issue when reporters questioned him on his views about the demonstration: “I only just learned about the protests yesterday; I don’t know much about the matter.” Meanwhile, a few other celebrities have taken the other side and publicly expressed support for the police. Award-winning actor Tony Leung Ka-fai, singer-songwriter Kenny Chung and Canto-pop singer Alan Tam Wing-lun showed up at a pro-police rally at the Tamar Park in Admiralty in June. Tam thanked and bowed to the police force on stage during the rally, and said that the way in which the police had been attacked in Hong Kong “had not been seen by the world before”. Chung agreed with Tam and said he couldn’t understand Hong Kong’s youth today and publicly supported the police force, which has been accused by protesters of abusing its power. After Chung and Tam’s public support of the police force, many protesters took to the internet to voice their frustrations, with some people destroying the artists’ CDs and even vinyl discs to show their discontent.",https://scmp.com/print/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3021575/what-do-celebrities-denise-ho-jackie-chan-alan-tam-tony

Protesters demand the full withdrawal of an unpopular extradition bill, which has already been shelved, and an independent investigation into the government’s handling of the political crisis.","Hong Kong International Airport was in recovery mode on Tuesday morning as airlines worked to send passengers to their destinations after a crippling citywide strike forced hundreds of flight cancellations. Hong Kong’s local airlines cancelled about 250 of 1,000 passenger flights on Monday after air traffic controllers, flight attendants, pilots and ground crew called in sick en masse in support of the anti-government strike. Congestion was widely expected at the global transport hub, which handles an average of 200,000 travellers each day, after dozens of flights were rescheduled for Tuesday. Twelve departing flights and 37 arrivals were cancelled on Tuesday. Hong Kong International Airport was scheduled to handle 511 departing flights on Tuesday and a similar number of arrivals – a nearly full schedule. Nineteen of Monday’s cancelled flights were rescheduled for Tuesday. Cathay Pacific and Dragon cancelled 20 services as of midday Tuesday, with HK Express delaying seven services and Hong Kong Airlines scrapping the same number. As the largest airlines with almost control of half of the take-off and landing slots, the majority of Cathay Pacific and Dragon services were leaving on time, however, a handful of services was experiencing delays to mainly Asian destinations. Some airlines, including the Cathay group, suspended free staff travel perks to rebook disrupted passengers on any flights with spare seats. For travellers heading to mainland China, both the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and cross-border intercity trains were offering normal services on Tuesday morning. On Monday morning, 10 scheduled cross-border intercity train services were cancelled, including five departing and five arriving. Services returned to normal after about 2.30pm on Monday. Ng, a former flight attendant, said a large number of aviation personnel went on strike. She understood that on a usual day, about 3,000 employees work at Cathay Pacific and 900 work at Cathay Dragon. She said she believed that about 1,500 Cathay Pacific staff and 500 Cathay Dragon employees did not go to work on Monday. A Cathay source explained the airport terminal congestion, saying flights were delayed from leaving their parking spots because there were more planes on the ground at the time.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3021565/hong-kong-international-airport-plays-catch-after
‘Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times’: Who came up with this protest chant and why is the government worried?,"First conceived as a localist election slogan in 2016, ‘Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times’ took awhile to resonate fully with discontented residents; Now the rallying cry has become the most commonly heard chant in the city amid anti-government protests","8:30am, 6 Aug, 2019","But over the past week, the rallying cry of the now-jailed student leader has become the most commonly heard chant in the city as long-running protests against the extradition bill have morphed into a full-blown anti-government movement.; The slogan’s growing resonance prompted the city’s leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to cite it on Monday as solid proof the nature of the movement had changed. She mentioned the slogans twice in her news conference, her first in two weeks.","When pro-independence activist Edward Leung Tin-kei first declared his election slogan “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” in 2016, not many could relate to it, let alone understand what it meant. Black-clad young protesters in balaclavas, masks and helmets have been leaving their imprint wherever they go by spray-painting the catchphrase since July 21 – the night scores of them vandalised Beijing’s liaison office in Sai Ying Pun and defaced the national emblem on the front entrance. “They … called for a revolution to liberate Hong Kong. These actions challenge national sovereignty, threaten ‘one country, two systems’, and will destroy the city’s prosperity and stability,” she said. Leung, then the spokesman of pro-independence group Hong Kong Indigenous, had once revealed in a rally that in crafting the slogan he had been struggling between “Revolution of the generation” and “Revolution of our times” but eventually opted for the latter as his election slogan for the legislature in a 2016 by-election. “An era is not categorised by one’s age. Even if you are old, you would belong to a new era as long as you believe in and embrace freedoms. But you would be in the old era if you can’t get rid of the old framework, even if you are very young,” he declared. Leung, now serving a six-year jail term over his role in the 2016 Mong Kok riot, said he was representing an era of people who were willing to use their “blood and sweat” to fight for their freedoms. A 28-year-old protester at a Sha Tin rally on Monday, who only gave her surname Yeung, said she could not relate to Leung’s slogan back then as she had no idea what precisely “Liberate Hong Kong” meant – until now. “The government is so skewed and there is also collusion between the police and the triads,” she said, making the allegation based on an incident in Yuen Long on July 21 when police failed to show up in time to stop a mob from indiscriminately attacking passengers and protesters. “We need to stand up to liberate Hong Kong – solely because we are Hongkongers who love the city very much.” Beijing loyalist Ip Kwok-him, also an adviser to Lam in the Executive Council, said there was no doubt it was a separatist slogan that aimed at overthrowing the central and local governments. “This small group of people still wants to live under colonial rule,” he said. But political scientist Dr Ma Ngok, of Chinese University, said the slogan itself was vague and open to interpretation. He said people opted for the term “revolution” because they felt Lam’s administration had already lost its moral basis to govern. Some also felt they were indebted to Leung because of his jail term, as well as those protesters who were charged with rioting over recent protests, he added. Engineering worker Tony Cheung, 28, who was protesting in Mong Kok on Monday, said he had skipped work to support the movement. Asked whether the movement was turning into a revolution, Cheung said the slogan just meant protesters felt “the government is rotten”. “If we wanted independence, then we would have called for independence,” he said. Matthew Chung, a 29-year-old who runs a music company, said they shouted the slogan because they wanted to revive the Hong Kong spirit and call for freedom and democracy. Andrew Fung Ho-keung, chief executive of the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, said Beijing would probably view the slogan as an alarming signal of a growing trend of independence advocacy in the city. Fung said Lam should tell the central government how to address the current crisis, instead of just pointing fingers at a handful of radicals.

However, transport authorities have warned the public to take “utmost care” on the roads as some traffic lights were damaged and not working properly. The government “strongly condemned” protester behaviour, including blocking roads and disrupting train services, in a statement published in the early hours of Tuesday. “The protesters’ organised acts disregarded law and order, deprived the right of other members of the public to go to work and carry on their daily lives, and seriously affected economic activities,” a government spokesman said. City transport came to a standstill on Monday, with major MTR lines paralysed by full or partial suspensions, a cross-harbour tunnel shut down, major highways in Admiralty, Wong Tai Sin and Tuen Mun blocked, and hundreds of flights at Hong Kong International Airport cancelled. MTR services were in disarray on Monday when groups of anti-government protesters blocked train doors at four key stations and interchanges. Eight MTR lines were badly affected, leading to confrontations between demonstrators and passengers. While trains skipped four stations on Monday night on the Tsuen Wan line – Lai Chi Kok, Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po and Kwai Fong – the latest information from the MTR website showed that all lines had good services on Tuesday morning. According to the Transport Department’s latest announcement at 7.08am, sections of five roads in Kowloon were closed to traffic: Sai Yee Street, Hak Po Street, Pak Po Street, Shantung Street and Nelson Street. The department advised the public that some traffic lights in the city were damaged and were not functioning normally. “Motorists should pay attention to the road situation, in particular the respective junctions with damaged traffic lights, and drive with utmost care on these affected road sections,” the department said on its HKeMobility mobile app. No specific traffic announcement was made on the sections of Kowloon roads near the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, which was blocked several times by protesters on Monday. Live traffic data from Google Map showed roads were open as usual, as of 6.30am on Tuesday. Bus operators KMB, New World First Bus and Citybus said all their routes have resumed services taking their original routes. The draft legislation, which has been shelved, would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city does not have an extradition agreement.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3021555/traffic-returning-normal-hong-kong-after-strike-chaos
"Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s reframing of battle with protesters as about sovereignty will fuel anger, observers and pro-Beijing lawmakers warn","Reactions to city leader’s remarks draw harsh criticism, one analysts saying ‘the confrontation is set to escalate’; Beijing loyalists also unimpressed by Lam’s press conference, which did not offer a way out of the current crisis","7:00am, 6 Aug, 2019","One analyst said Lam’s comments – her first in public in two weeks – would only fan the flames of discontent, and would do little to end the weeks of protests, most of which are increasingly violent.; She insisted the protests were no longer about her governance or the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city does not have a formal handover agreement.; In her address, Lam condemned protesters who chanted “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” and threw a Chinese flag into the harbour, after tens of thousands defied a police ban and joined an unlawful march from Tai Kok Tsui to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday.; He said Lam’s repeated condemnation of protesters’ actions would not cool tensions.; Some Beijing loyalists were also unimpressed by Lam’s press conference, which did not offer a way out of the current crisis.; A 20-year-old university student, who sat on a Fortress Hill MTR platform on Monday morning listening to a live stream of Lam’s press conference, said her remarks would only make him and other young people angrier.","The move by Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to define the recent unrest in the city as an attack on Beijing’s sovereignty could escalate already heightened tensions between the government and its opponents, political observers have warned. Hong Kong was brought to a standstill on Monday morning as protesters paralysed the city’s MTR railway system by blocking train doors, in response to calls for a citywide strike. Lam said she would not accept any of the protesters’ demands, such as for her to resign and for a commission of inquiry into the clashes between demonstrators and police that have roiled the city since early June. Professor Joseph Chan Cho-wai, a political scientist at the University of Hong Kong, said the chief executive’s remarks in her press conference on Monday only “added fuel to the fire”. He and Andrew Fung Ho-keung, chief executive of the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, expected the police to take tougher action against protesters after Lam’s new characterisation of the clashes. “The confrontation between protesters and police is set to escalate as Lam failed to respond to protesters’ demands,” Chan said. “I’m worried that deaths and serious injuries will happen, as the clashes between two sides are turning more violent.” Fung said he was worried the government would take a tougher stance after Lam claimed that the nature of the ongoing protests had transformed into an attack on Beijing’s sovereignty and the “one country, two systems” framework, under which the city is promised certain freedoms not allowed in the rest of China. “By labelling the protests [as] attacks on the national sovereignty, the government will have strong grounds not to respond to demands of members of the public, but resort to tougher actions against protesters,” he said. “She needs to come up with feasible ways to defuse the crisis,” he said. Chan said he believed Lam wanted to tell the public it was no longer a problem with her governance as the nature of the protests had changed. “I expect the government to engage in a battle of public opinion with protesters,” he said. “The government will strive to win over members of the public who want stability.” But Chan said the government would struggle to win over moderate residents unless it responds to some of protesters’ demands. “The police are fighting a losing battle unless the government takes bold steps to curb civil liberties in Hong Kong,” he said. Ann Chiang Lai-wan, a lawmaker from the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), wrote on her Facebook page that Lam had raised a lot of issues at the press conference but did not come up with any solutions. “Disappointed!” she wrote. Gary Chan Hak-kan, a lawmaker and DAB vice-chairman, said the protests were hitting the local economy, and called for society to take a break from protests and return to normal. “The biggest challenge now is to counter the trend of economic downturn,” he said. Claudia Mo Man-ching, convenor of the pan-democratic camp in the Legislative Council, said Lam had to be held accountable if Hong Kong became dragged down a “path of no return”, a phrase used by the chief executive on Monday. Mo said Lam was responsible for the damage to society, which the city leader had instead pinned on protesters. “She is like a recording machine repeating condemnations. She condemns the damage of inanimate things and doesn’t care about the use of excessive force on people,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021527/chief-executive-carrie-lams-reframing-battle-protesters
US not saying if it will ban sales of tear gas and other riot-control gear to Hong Kong police,A weekend of violent clashes between police and protesters and a citywide strike raise the question of whether US will follow Britain’s example; US lawmakers want the government to announce it ‘will not contribute to the internal repression of peaceful protest in Hong Kong’,"4:47am, 6 Aug, 2019","One analyst said Lam’s comments – her first in public in two weeks – would only fan the flames of discontent, and would do little to end the weeks of protests, most of which are increasingly violent.; She insisted the protests were no longer about her governance or the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city does not have a formal handover agreement.; In her address, Lam condemned protesters who chanted “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” and threw a Chinese flag into the harbour, after tens of thousands defied a police ban and joined an unlawful march from Tai Kok Tsui to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday.; He said Lam’s repeated condemnation of protesters’ actions would not cool tensions.; Some Beijing loyalists were also unimpressed by Lam’s press conference, which did not offer a way out of the current crisis.; A 20-year-old university student, who sat on a Fortress Hill MTR platform on Monday morning listening to a live stream of Lam’s press conference, said her remarks would only make him and other young people angrier.","The United States government refused to say on Monday whether it would follow Britain in suspending sales of munitions to the Hong Kong police force after a weekend of violent clashes between police and protesters and a citywide strike. US lawmakers wrote two government agencies last week, calling for a temporary ban on future sales of crowd and riot control equipment and a public announcement that the US “will not contribute to the internal repression of peaceful protest in Hong Kong”. In a bipartisan appeal, House representatives Christopher Smith and James McGovern said “further scrutiny of the types of programmes and contacts the US engages in with the Hong Kong police force will be needed moving forward”. The lawmakers had yet to receive a response to their letter, a spokesman for Smith said on Monday. When asked on Monday whether the State Department was considering suspending munition sales to Hong Kong authorities, an agency spokeswoman said she could not comment on specific direct commercial sales licensing activities, citing federal law. Reviews of the transfer of defence-related goods and services were carried out by the US government on a “case by case basis”, the spokeswoman said, adding that the government “weighs the economic, national security, foreign policy and human rights implications of each proposed transfer in making its decision or recommendation”. “Review and monitoring is an integral component of assistance delivered to any recipient nation to make sure that assistance is being used in the manner intended,” she said. Activists in Hong Kong have accused the police of using disproportionate force and of violating munition protocol: for example, by firing rubber bullet rounds – which suppliers say should only be fired at regions below the waist – at head-level. According to city authorities, police have fired 1,000 tear gas canisters since June 9, when unrest triggered by a proposed amendment to Hong Kong’s extradition laws first erupted. Photographs circulated online from the past weekend’s clashes between protesters and police show city police used at least one US-made canister type. The vendor, Pennsylvania-based Nonlethal Technologies, declined to comment on the calls for an export ban when contacted on Monday. A commerce department spokesman said US exports of tear gas and other law enforcement equipment – including pepper spray, police helmets, shields and batons – to Hong Kong all required licences from the agency, which reviews the licence requests in consultation with the departments of state and defence. “When licences are issued, the department remains committed to strictly enforcing those licences,” the spokesman said. The calls from Smith and McGovern for a ban on US munition sales to Hong Kong joined a growing body of similar appeals from campaigners in the city. A White House petition launched in July by student activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung demanding a suspension of crowd control equipment exports has amassed close to 110,000 signatures, passing the 100,000 required for a response from the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In June, Britain’s then-foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that no further export licenses for crowd control equipment would be issued to vendors until human rights concerns were addressed. Hunt also called for “a robust, independent” investigation into the Hong Kong police force’s handling of protests, a request echoed in the US lawmakers’ letter. Responding to the congressmen’s appeal on Monday, the Chinese government said the US was ignoring “issues of widespread police brutality and abuse of powers in its own country”. Criticism of the Hong Kong police force would only show to the world the “arrogance, prejudice, hypocrisy, coldbloodedness, selfishness and oppressiveness of the United States,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a regular press briefing. In their letter, the congressmen also called on the agency heads “to push back, in the strongest terms possible”, against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments’ efforts to characterise the demonstrations as “riots”. The likelihood of such a move waned significantly last week when US President Donald Trump himself adopted the language of Beijing and called the ongoing protests “riots”. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the matter was between Hong Kong and China, “because Hong Kong is a part of China. They’ll have to deal with that themselves. They don’t need advice.” Beijing has consistently evoked Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong to reject critical remarks from foreign governments about the situation in the city. Smith said on Monday that Hong Kong’s “unique status” meant that ""this crisis cannot simply be dismissed as a matter internal to China”.  “There are clear global interests in preserving Hong Kong’s autonomy and the guaranteed rights of its citizens,” he said. “As such, the US must clearly signal to the Hong Kong and Chinese governments that the escalation of tensions needlessly prolongs political instability that they created.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/world/article/3021546/us-not-saying-if-it-will-ban-sale-tear-gas-and-other-riot-control-gear
Hongkongers support protests from afar as flash mobs across US and Canada add oil,‘Lennon Walls’ spring up at New York event on Sunday as organisers voice backing for protesters and try to educate American public about the unrest; Similar events are held in seven Canadian cities over the weekend,"2:55am, 6 Aug, 2019","In recent weeks, Hong Kong expatriates living in New York have become increasingly concerned over the protests in their hometown. Late last week, Michelle Ng, a 34-year-old freelance designer who has lived in New York for the past 12 years, decided to do something about it.; A few feet away, organisers had spread out two dozen yellow umbrellas on the ground beside impromptu “Lennon Walls” made from FedEx boxes decorated with Post-it notes from passers-by who had stopped to ask questions. “Don’t give up” and “New Yorkers support Hong Kong!” some read. “Hong Kong is not China” and “The revolution of our time”, others said.; “I’m scared,” Yuki Wong, a 17-year-old student who left Hong Kong five years ago, said. “Maybe the PLA [China’s People’s Liberation Army] is coming in. China may feel it’s losing control.; The five demands made by protesters include the full withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill – which would allow the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal, including mainland China – and an inquiry into the police’s handling of the protests. The proposed bill has been suspended but not formally withdrawn.; But there was acknowledgement that educating Americans and persuading them to focus on Hong Kong was not easy given their domestic concerns, including mass shootings in Texas and Ohio over the weekend, US President Donald Trump’s litany of inflammatory tweets and next year’s presidential election.","On Thursday evening, she gathered 20 people born in – or with strong ties to – the city at a Starbucks cafe near the Empire State Building to brainstorm. The group debated ideas on how to show their support over lattes and cappuccinos. Someone thought about walking through New York Subway tunnels with yellow umbrellas, but this was rejected as being too disruptive. Others proposed art exhibits or film screenings, but they decided that would take too long to organise. Finally, they settled on a flash mob. Within hours, they were working their networks, spreading word through Facebook, Instagram and phone messaging. Sunday afternoon’s event in Washington Square Park, in the heart of Greenwich Village, attracted more than 100 people who voiced strong support for Hong Kong protesters, one of several such events held across North America over the weekend. “We wanted to do something today so that when everyone wakes up in Hong Kong, they know they’re not alone,” Ng said. “I wish I was in Hong Kong now to show our support, but we all do what we can.” Organisers and participants at the New York event said they had not encountered any physical hostility from pro-Beijing Chinese before Sunday or earlier get-togethers, although several said they had been attacked online, often virulently, by Chinese trolls. Ng, who lives in a heavily Chinese-American community, said she had travelled by subway to Sunday’s flash mob with a painting she had made depicting a Hong Kong protester with goggles, a yellow hard hat and a sign that read “Free Hong Kong”. On the train, several New Yorkers saw her painting and voiced their support, some even shouting “Ga yao” – the Cantonese expression of encouragement meaning “add oil”. “But the Chinese people didn’t say anything,” Ng said. .“It’s kind of painful when you see your fellow countrymen aren’t supporting it.” With Hong Kong’s weekend protests having become routine, some participants at Sunday’s event worried that China’s central government was losing patience. “We should not trust China. They said they would give us 50 years of freedom, but they’re breaking their word. It’s becoming ‘one country, one system’,” she added, referencing the “one country, two systems” principle under which Beijing promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after it was returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997. New York’s flash mob dovetailed with similar events held across Canada at the weekend, in the cities of Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Winnipeg, Halifax and Montreal. “It was beyond our expectations – we expected 20 to 40 and had over 100 people,” Grace Li, who helped organise the Montreal event, said. “The concern from the public and the media has been much greater than expected.” This came as details spread about the latest developments from Hong Kong, with word that police had fired tear gas in the Causeway Bay shopping district and protesters had occupied streets, blocked the cross-harbour tunnel and vandalised the Golden Bauhinia statue in Wan Chai, and with a general strike to take place on Monday. Li said she and the others had watched events unfold “with mixed feelings and broken hearts”. “What do we want? Democracy!” people chanted at Sunday’s New York flash mob. “When do we want it? Now!” One analyst said the growing number of overseas events to show support for demonstrators suggested a global awareness of the stakes as China’s power expands. “Protests in places like New York and Washington speak to the deep chord that has been struck by the protesters back in Hong Kong,” Thomas Kellogg, executive director of Georgetown University’s Centre for Asian Law, said. “Beijing should take note. When it comes to the battle of ideas, they are fighting a losing battle. And the reputational costs that they are paying continue to mount.” Not everyone who wandered past the New York event supported the Hong Kong protests. Mary Ng, a “50-something” medical secretary originally from Guangzhou, near Hong Kong in southern China, said she did not think Beijing was getting enough credit. “The Chinese government has tried to make Hong Kong better through the economy,” she said, citing the Greater Bay Area project to link Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong province. “Hong Kong has tried to fight with Beijing. They’re being a bit spoilt; I think they should just accept the way it is. If Hongkongers cooperated with mainland people, their life would be better.” But the New York event also included a few participants from mainland China who strongly supported the goals of the Hong Kong protesters. Wan, a 29-year-old from Guangzhou wearing a black T-shirt – black clothes being the unofficial uniform of the protests – said he was there to show his support despite often being attacked online, accused of selling out and of being a traitor to the motherland when he posts anything even mildly supportive of the protesters. “I feel like this is the right thing to do,” said another 20-something man from southern China dressed in black, his face covered by a surgical mask – also in common with many Hong Kong protesters. “They need to meet the protesters’ five demands, and at this point there’s a lot of police brutality. Police brutality is not good in any place, whether it’s Hong Kong, the mainland or the United States.” Organisers estimated they had engaged with nearly 200 members of the public in a sea of dog walkers, hipsters and kids squealing in a nearby fountain. “It was very successful,” Nicole Izsak, one of the organisers, said. “There’s a lot going on here,” said Roxie Chang, 26, who grew up in Hong Kong and has lived in New York for eight years. “But we’re trying.” Joel McGill, a 31-year-old audiovisual technician, stopped to look at the many Post-it notes. “It seems like it’s really escalating over there and not even safe to be on the street,” he said, adding that he had never been to Hong Kong but wanted to visit. As the flash mob dissipated, organisers reflected on the day. “It’s important to have these events to show our support, but I really wish I were in Hong Kong right now helping there,” Chang said with a sigh. “There’s a limit to what you can do over here.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021533/hongkongers-support-protests-afar-flash-mobs-across-us-and
Anti-government protesters unleash chaos across Hong Kong in unprecedented citywide rampage,"City leader Carrie Lam warns demonstrators have gone beyond protests to attack national sovereignty; Police have fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas since the first clashes erupted on June 9, arresting 502 people in total","12:45am, 6 Aug, 2019","“Hong Kong has been the safest city in the world,” a grim-faced Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said earlier in the day at her first press conference in weeks.; For ordinary Hongkongers, it was a day to be met with fortitude as trains were delayed and buses stopped on the roads. MTR services ground to a halt during the morning rush hour as protesters blocked doors to stop trains from leaving.; Airport services were hit hard as well, with some 250 flights cancelled as air traffic controllers called in sick and airline staff joined the strike.","Defiant protesters unleashed chaos and violence across Hong Kong on Monday in an unprecedented escalation of radical action against the government and police, even as the city’s embattled leader toughened her stance and warned that they had gone beyond protests to attack the nation’s sovereignty. After calling a citywide strike aimed at crippling traffic and daily business, protesters throughout the day and into the night besieged police stations in Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, Sha Tin, Tsim Sha Tsui, Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan, launching arson attacks at some of them. Police fired tear gas in flashpoints stretching across seven districts, saying they were using “minimal force” to disperse radical protesters who blocked more than a dozen main roads and three major tunnels, set up barricades, started fires, and attacked law enforcers with petrol bombs, bricks and other projectiles. More than 80 people were arrested, nine of them in the working-class neighbourhood of Wong Tai Sin, which was caught up in six hours of clashes between protesters and police who fired multiple rounds of tear gas and sponge grenades. Protesters threw petrol bombs into the police station’s compound and again targeted the disciplinary service quarters nearby, where officers’ families live. In a shocking escalation in North Point, protesters were attacked in the middle of the road, in full public view, by about a dozen men with bamboo poles. Demonstrators fought back with metal rods and hurled objects at them, later outnumbering the attackers and chasing them into a building on Ming Yuen Western Street. Angry protesters besieged the building, and broke a window of a flat where two men brandished knives at them. The running battles in districts wore on into the night, with tear gas being fired in the poorest neighbourhood of Sham Shui Po, where protesters and residents clashed with police. Close to midnight, a group of protesters returned to Causeway Bay and headed towards Wan Chai, targeting the police headquarters, where they hurled objects at the building, leading to fresh rounds of tear gas. At midnight in Tuen Mun, police again used tear gas as protesters charged towards them, ending a 10-minute stand-off, while in Tsuen Wan, protesters clashed with a white-clad group brandishing metal poles and knives. At least four were injured. By 1.30am, at the Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po protest sites, scores of demonstrators were still camped out. Outside Mong Kok Police Station, officers fired tear gas again to disperse the crowd, but to no avail. “But this series of extremely violent acts is pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous situation; some extreme activists have altered the nature of these [protests], resorting to violent means to express their aspirations. “They removed the national flag, threw it into the sea, and called for a revolution to liberate Hong Kong ... These actions have challenged national sovereignty, threatened ‘one country, two systems’, and will destroy the city’s prosperity and stability.” Lam made it clear there would be no compromise, repeatedly referencing the popular protest slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”, along with almost daily violence and lawlessness, as evidence that the movement had gone beyond its original opposition to the now-abandoned extradition bill and escalated into an anti-national campaign. “Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city’s future?” Lam said. “Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said was to bring collateral damage, will push Hong Kong onto a path of no return.” Eight MTR lines were hit hard, and the railway operator arranged for 15 shuttle buses to ferry stranded commuters. Tempers flared, and at Fortress Hill station, a man became distressed, yelling that his pregnant wife was about to go into labour and angrily waving aside protesters who offered to help. Video clips showed a black van ramming through barricades set up by protesters outside the Cross-Harbour Tunnel’s Hung Hom exit, and a taxi mowing down picketers trying to block Harcourt Road in Admiralty. A man who drove through a barricade was earlier stopped by an angry crowd at Healthy Street West, some of whom punched him and shattered his windscreen as he got out and argued. A protester said the driver almost hit people with the vehicle. Shops and businesses across the city closed early, and workers were given the rest of the day off to avoid any chaos heading their way. Protesters first took to the streets for what they billed as peaceful rallies in seven locations during the day. But before long it was apparent many were out to target police officers and their stations. They vandalised multiple stations, throwing bricks, eggs and other projectiles at the windows and building fronts, spray-painted obscene graffiti on the walls, and yelled insults at officers who mostly remained barricaded inside. The mobs used wooden crates, branches and rubbish bins to start fires at the gates of several police stations. At the Sha Tin police base, the fire became large enough to force officers from higher floors in the building to spray water on the flames. For the first time in two months of mass protests which were triggered by the extradition bill, police fired tear gas early in the day, their patience running low under an endless barrage of attacks and abuse. At the first of daily press briefings that police will hold from now on, it was revealed that they had fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas since the first clashes erupted on June 9 and arrested 502 people in total. The protesters played cat-and-mouse with police, retreating with each firing of tear gas and advancing again, the aim being to draw police out at multiple locations simultaneously to frustrate and wear them down. Countless rounds of tear gas were fired in the business district of Admiralty and the tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui, as well as in the residential neighbourhoods in Wong Tai Sin and Tai Po, which were turned into war zones. Tear gas was also used outside Tin Shui Wai Police Station, where an angry crowd accused police of sexual violence after a young woman’s underwear was exposed while she was taken away by several officers on Monday morning. Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan insisted officers had not behaved inappropriately, and blamed the woman for putting up a fight and resisting arrest. At the press conference with Lam, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po appealed for an end to the protests, warning the economy was in trouble because of both the ongoing US-China trade war and internal instability. Hong Kong stocks saw their longest declining stretch in more than two decades, with the Hang Seng Index dropping 2.9 per cent to 26,151 points. Asked if she, or any member of her cabinet, would take responsibility for the social unrest and step down, Lam insisted she would not resign, especially when Hong Kong’s future was at stake. “When the well-being of 7 million people is facing huge challenges, this is no longer about my personal honour. My colleagues and I have the responsibility to stand fast to our positions,” she said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021538/anti-government-protesters-unleash-chaos-across-hong-kong

Then on Monday at about 7pm, a group of protesters went to the same flagstaff in Tsim Sha Tsui, tore down the flag again and threw it into the harbour, the second such incident in three days. In both cases, the protesters escaped. In North Point, the Pui Kiu Middle School organised a flag-raising ceremony at the campus on Monday even though the school was officially on summer holidays. Principal Ng Wun-kit said teachers and students were called back on short notice to take part. “We saw [on the news] that some rioters in helmets threw the Chinese national flag in the harbour and we strongly condemn such behaviour. It was disrespectful,” Ng said. “We wanted to show that we are one of the 1.4 billion Chinese people who want to protect the national flag. We hope that the students, teachers and [Hong Kong] citizens who love the country and the Chinese Communist Party can respect the Chinese flag.” Other Hong Kong businesses and organisations flying the Chinese flag on Monday included international hotel chain Courtyard by Marriott Hong Kong, Chinese engineering firm Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries and Chinese pharmaceutical giant Beijing Tong Ren Tang. A spokeswoman from the hotel chain said it had flown the flag for many years and Monday was no exception. “We display the flag because we are a Chinese-funded company. We do not have plans to take it down any time soon,” she said. On Sunday, a group of Beijing supporters sang the national anthem and raised the Chinese flag in Tsim Sha Tsui to replace the one taken down. On microblogging site Weibo, mainland Chinese and Hong Kong celebrities were among those forwarding pictures of the flag or salutes to it, adding the hashtag “the Chinese national flag has 1.4 billion flag bearers”, a topic started by China Central Television (CCTV) on Sunday. As of Monday night, the trending topic had been read more than 2 billion times, with more than 8 million posts and support from Hong Kong actors Jackie Chan, Jordan Chan Siu-chun and Hawick Lau Hoi-Wai. In a commentary published online on Sunday, CCTV said the topic had attracted a strong response because patriotism ran deep among the Chinese people. “We protect the flag, the national emblem, our country, and we protect our country like we protect our own homes,” it said. Analysts said the mood on Chinese social media had changed as protesters in Hong Kong vandalised symbols of the central government, crossing a line for most mainland Chinese. Wang Jiangyu, an associate law professor at the National University of Singapore, said that although many mainlanders had admired Hong Kong and sympathised with its civil movements in the past, the situation had changed. “The Chinese flag being insulted is on the top of a list of things mainlanders dislike, and for state media, which represent the central government’s position, focusing on such issues can frame the protesters as enemies of the Chinese nation or the people,” Wang said. “It can increase the hatred of mainlanders towards the Hong Kong protesters and gain support for the central government to take action in the future.” Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University of Hong Kong, said mainland media were using the incident to achieve their own propaganda purposes. “Mainland media made it seem like [the flag protest was] the theme for the whole movement … but it does not represent the main demands of the anti-extradition movement. They are turning single actions into broad propaganda, and biasing mainland sentiment about Hong Kong,” Ma said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/society/article/3021535/celebrities-businesses-and-school-take-patriotic-stand-after
Commuters and businesses take hit from Hong Kong’s anti-government strike,Emergency services vehicles are forced to detour around roadblocks as protesters obstruct traffic,"11:05pm, 5 Aug, 2019","“Hong Kong has been the safest city in the world,” a grim-faced Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said earlier in the day at her first press conference in weeks.; For ordinary Hongkongers, it was a day to be met with fortitude as trains were delayed and buses stopped on the roads. MTR services ground to a halt during the morning rush hour as protesters blocked doors to stop trains from leaving.; Airport services were hit hard as well, with some 250 flights cancelled as air traffic controllers called in sick and airline staff joined the strike.","An anti-government strike that paralysed transport across Hong Kong on Monday not only brought chaos for tens of thousands of commuters but also hit businesses and emergency services in the international financial hub. Shop owners said they suffered a big drop in business, while a senior fire services officer said the demonstrators obstructed ambulances and fire engines. The comments came after protesters brought the city’s MTR subway system to a near standstill during the morning rush hour by blocking train doors and pressing emergency buttons. By about 10.12am, all MTR lines were affected, and the system did not resume normal services until around 1pm. While some commuters and visitors said they were sympathetic to the protesters, scuffles and arguments erupted between MTR users and the demonstrators. In Tuen Mun, protesters gave out free burgers to affected passengers and drivers to apologise for the inconvenience. Protesters also blocked several major highways, including the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, as well as Nathan Road in Mong Kok, Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, Harcourt Road in Admiralty and Tuen Mun Highway in Tuen Mun. They walked down the middle of the roads, and used metal barricades, rubbish bins and other items to block vehicles and snarl traffic. Some 250 flights were cancelled on Monday as various airport staff, ranging from flight attendants to air traffic controllers, called in sick in support of the day’s action. The Fire Services Department said roadblocks set up by protesters around the city had obstructed ambulances and fire engines. The department also said it was concerned about the potential risk of bombs being set off in dense urban areas. “Officers needed to remove barriers before they proceed on some occasions. On other occasions, they have to take a detour,” deputy chief fire officer Cheng Sui-on said. In Tsim Sha Tsui, a shopping district popular with tourists from mainland China, there were noticeably fewer people on the streets than usual. David Ong, a 60-year-old businessman visiting the city with his wife and young son, said he would delay future business trips to the city. “If the protests don’t stop, it’s no good, how can we come again?” Ong said. But other visitors said their plans had not been disrupted. “Protesters should be permitted to do what they are doing,” said Australian tourist Don Just, 69. The retiree said traffic disruption on Monday did not affect him much, and he still felt Hong Kong was a safe city. Around Harbour Crystal Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, some shops were closed, but most of the big retailers and restaurant chains remained open. Han Sueng-min, owner of Korean hot dog shop Bat Boys,said his daily takings had halved. Next door, Lang Lang Noodle boss KC Hung said his sales were down by about 40 per cent and he was worried whether his business would continue. “The political crisis needs to be resolved, but protesters need to be more peaceful,” Hung said. A Danish businessman, who has lived in Hong Kong for more than a decade, said the protests had divided the roughly 70 employees at the electronics firm where he worked. Nine weeks of protests had forced his company to consider contingency plans, with some employees saying they wanted to move away from the city because of safety concerns. “I think it’s very disturbing,” he said, declining to be named. “It’s affecting our work; some people didn’t want to go to work. You have workers on the black side, some on the white side. “It’s dangerous for us, running the business. We need the business to be safe, but right now, it’s not safe.” But on popular local online forum LIHKG, internet users called the action on Monday a success. “We have done a good job today [Monday] to create enough impact.

Hong Kong protests: Filipino dancer and 15-year-old boy among those charged over weekend clashes in Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin,"Charges range from unlawful assembly and failing to provide proof of ID, to assaulting and obstructing police; Sixteen suspects were expected to appear in court but five remain in hospital","10:59pm, 5 Aug, 2019","“Hong Kong has been the safest city in the world,” a grim-faced Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said earlier in the day at her first press conference in weeks.; For ordinary Hongkongers, it was a day to be met with fortitude as trains were delayed and buses stopped on the roads. MTR services ground to a halt during the morning rush hour as protesters blocked doors to stop trains from leaving.; Airport services were hit hard as well, with some 250 flights cancelled as air traffic controllers called in sick and airline staff joined the strike.","A Filipino and 15 Hongkongers have been formally charged over the clashes that broke out in Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin over the weekend. Of those, 12 have been accused of taking part in an unlawful assembly on Nathan Road in Mong Kok on Saturday. They include Filipino dancer Jethro Santiago Pioquinto, 36, and six students, the youngest a 15-year-old boy. One of the students, Ann Han Ming-yan, 22, was charged with an additional count of failing to produce proof of identity on demand. A 31-year-old cook, Lau Wai-lun, faced a sole count of obstructing police, which allegedly took place at the junction of Nathan Road and Prince Edward Road West in Mong Kok on Sunday. Three other men, student Yim Sai-wang, 20, baker Aidan Tam Ho-yu, 24, and transport worker Tsang Tin-lok, 22, were accused of assaulting three police officers outside Wong Tai Sin Police Station on Sunday. Their cases stemmed from protests in the popular shopping district of Mong Kok on Saturday, which later spilled over to Kowloon City and Wong Tai Sin, home to the temple devoted to the Taoist deity of the same name. The 16 defendants had been divided into two groups, and had been expected to make their first court appearances before two magistrates on Monday afternoon. But five did not show up in court as they were still being treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Jordan, and Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan. One required surgery for a fractured arm. The remaining defendants were taken to Kowloon City Court in police vans. Heightened security measures were observed outside the court building, where dozens of uniformed police officers and a handful of traffic wardens guarded the entrances. Some officers were seen intercepting people dressed in black, searching through their belongings and opening their umbrellas. About 100 people turned up to show support, but most could not squeeze into the small courtroom so they waited in the lobby for news. Among those seated in the public gallery was Paulo Velasco Saret, the Philippine consul in Hong Kong, who came to observe proceedings but declined to comment. Pioquinto showed up in the dock with thick bandages around his right forearm. The South China Morning Post learned he had complained of being struck in the head with a baton during his arrest, and sustained injuries to his right forearm and knee. His co-defendant, 22-year-old photographer Lee Wing-ho, also complained that police had injured his waist and leg during his arrest. None of the defendants was required to enter a plea before Magistrate Raymond Wong Kwok-fai as police needed more time to investigate. Prosecutors did not object to their bail so long as conditions were imposed. Wong released all eight men and three women on cash bail of between HK$1,000 and HK$2,000 (US$128 and US$255), on condition they remain in Hong Kong, report to a police station once a week and adhere to a curfew of at least six hours up to 6am. The two youngest defendants, 15 and 16, were also required to pay a HK$1,000 surety and obey a stricter curfew from 11pm to 6am. All were ordered to return to the same court on September 30. Those who were in hospital were expected to make their first court appearance on Thursday and Friday, or as soon as they were discharged. Also on Monday, a former Hong Kong civil servant known for taking the government to court applied for a judicial review challenging three police commanders’ handling of the mob violence at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21. Kwok Cheuk-kin, widely known as “the king of judicial reviews”, said in his application to the High Court the officers’ inaction breached the Police Force Ordinance and amounted to malfeasance. The three officers were identified as: Yuen Long District Commander and Chief Superintendent Lee Wai-man, Assistant Commander Yau Nai-keung and Pat Heung divisional commander Li Hon-man.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021532/hong-kong-protests-filipino-dancer-and-15-year-old-boy
"Beijing again gives ‘unflagging support’ to Carrie Lam, warns Hong Kong is entering ‘most dangerous phase’","Communist Party mouthpiece calls on city to put a stop to violent and continued social unrest as ‘no place can survive such turmoil’; Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office will brief media on Tuesday, and ‘something new’ will be announced, according to a source","10:52pm, 5 Aug, 2019",That was followed by an editorial in Monday’s People Daily saying that the real target of the radical protesters was not the now-shelved extradition bill.,"Beijing has reiterated its “unflagging support” for embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and warned that the city was entering “a most dangerous phase” with rampant violence on the streets. Hong Kong must put a stop to the violent and continued social unrest in the city as “no place can survive such turmoil”, said a commentary to be published on Tuesday in Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily. Read out on state broadcaster CCTV on Monday, it said the central government would give “unflagging support” to Hong Kong’s chief executive and her administration to take lawful action to restore order. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China’s cabinet, plans to hold a media briefing in the capital on Tuesday afternoon. An official familiar with the matter said “something new” would be announced, but he did not elaborate. The South China Morning Post will carry live coverage of the press conference from 2.30pm. It comes after the HKMAO – Beijing’s top office on Hong Kong affairs – last week broke its silence on the escalating unrest in the city, giving its first media briefing since the former British colony returned to China in 1997. The press conferences are part of efforts by Beijing to rally support for the beleaguered Hong Kong government. It has also summoned the city’s top political advisers – members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – and national lawmakers to the neighbouring city of Shenzhen on Wednesday for a crunch meeting. Meanwhile, mainland Chinese media has stepped up rhetoric on the turmoil in Hong Kong after protesters removed the national flag from a pole in popular tourist district Tsim Sha Tsui and threw it into Victoria Harbour over the weekend. The city would risk becoming a “stinky and dead harbour” if it slid into anarchy, a CCTV commentary read out on the prime time news broadcast warned on Sunday. “Hong Kong is at a crossroads of order and chaos. The fate of the city is still in the hands of 7 million Hongkongers,” it said, warning that violent protests would not bring democracy or freedom and would only destroy the city’s peace and prosperity. The commentary also warned that the instigators and people taking part in the violent protests would “face the consequences when the time comes”, without elaborating. “[We] must solemnly tell the thugs who have unrealistic hopes and wish to further disrupt Hong Kong: you will pay a price for your craziness,” it said. The commentary went on to slam protesters for trying to take their case to the international community. “Your foreign mums and dads won’t be your guardians,” it said. “Please be aware of your errors and turn back from your wrong path. Please drop your knife.” “They are seeking to cause chaos in Hong Kong and destroy ‘one country, two systems’,” it said. Li Xiaobing, a specialist on Beijing’s policy on Hong Kong at Nankai University in Tianjin, said the series of statements reflected the central government’s fury over the situation in the city. “The acts targeting [the national emblem and national flag], to the central government, are repeatedly breaching its bottom line,” Li said, referring to protesters defacing the national emblem outside Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong. “These comments underline Beijing’s anger and denunciation of the radicals.” Zhang Dinghuai, a Hong Kong policy researcher at Shenzhen University, said Beijing still wanted the city’s government to handle the crisis itself. “There are people who want to force a showdown with Beijing and to damage ‘one country, two systems’ by doing that. But Hong Kong is still not out of control and Beijing will leave it to the Hong Kong government to resolve the crisis.” Additional reporting by William Zheng",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3021530/beijing-again-gives-unflagging-support-carrie-lam-warns-hong
"Hong Kong residents wake up to transport chaos with suspended train service, blocked roads and cancelled flights as extradition bill protesters launch citywide strike","City comes to standstill in morning as protesters block roads, disrupt train services and airport officials skip duty, resulting in cancellation of flights; Scuffles break out between commuters and protesters at MTR stations, while police rush in to clear blockade at Hung Hom Cross-Harbour Tunnel","10:38pm, 5 Aug, 2019",That was followed by an editorial in Monday’s People Daily saying that the real target of the radical protesters was not the now-shelved extradition bill.,"Hong Kong commuters on Monday woke up to what was believed to be the worst transport chaos since the 2014 Occupy movement, bringing the city to a standstill, with major MTR lines coming to a full or partial halt, a cross-harbour tunnel shut down, several key roads blocked, and hundreds of flights cancelled. The first signs of MTR service disruption emerged as early as 7.30am at four major stations and interchanges when groups of anti-government protesters, mostly wearing masks and in black, poured onto platforms and blocked train doors, triggering heated verbal exchanges with commuters. At Fortress Hill MTR station on the Island line, rescuers had to be called in after a pregnant woman fell sick around 8am. Her husband shouted: “Ambulance! Police! My wife is about to give birth!” He then shouted at protesters: “You are messing up Hong Kong. You always ask the government to reflect. You should reflect on yourselves first.” There were also reports of minor scuffles between commuters and protesters at some stations. Around 8.20am at Lai King station on the Tsuen Wan line, a protester blocking a train door was shoved off the train. MTR services resumed at about 12.45pm. And there was no news of service disruption of the high-speed cross-border rail at press time. Part of an escalating anti-government movement that started off with protests two months ago against the now-shelved extradition bill, Monday’s so-called “uncooperative campaign” was aimed more at preventing people from going to work. Among the main demands of protesters are the complete withdrawal of the bill and an independent investigation into police’s handling of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, a group of protesters forming a flash mob also shut down the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, blocking roads using plastic barricades at about 7.30am. Police rushed in to clear the area, but the blockade had already resulted in a traffic jam. At the airport, air traffic controllers called in sick en masse, affecting flight departures and arrivals. “We advise passengers to contact their airlines first, and to proceed to the airport only when their seats and flight times have been confirmed,” an Airport Authority spokesman said in a statement. “The Airport Emergency Centre has been activated at 7am to coordinate operations among various business partners. Airport operations continue to be orderly. Flight movements are likely to be increased gradually from the afternoon.” In-town check-in services at Airport Express stations were also suspended. Filipino domestic helpers – Angiels Rondalas, 67, and her friend Amelia Quia – arrived at the airport five hours in advance for their 1pm flight to Manila to avoid any disruption, only to find it had been cancelled. “I have been in Hong Kong for last 30 years, but have never seen things like this. Now I don’t leave the house to be safe even during vacations,” Rondalas said. Tech professional Davis Ng, 45, was sympathetic to the protesters’ cause. His 2.30pm Cathay Pacific flight to Singapore was cancelled, but he bought a ticket for an 8am Singapore Airlines flight instead. “It is not inconvenient for me to change to an earlier flight. I already knew about the strike and could plan in advance accordingly. The traffic to the airport was very smooth as well. People understand what the situation is all about,” Ng said. But just getting to the airport proved to be a challenge for some in the morning, with protesters forcing the Airport Express train service to be suspended briefly. Taxi drivers seemed to be benefitting from the transport paralysis. Taxi driver Leung Tat-chong, who is also a member of the Motor Transport Workers General Union, said some of his fellow cabbies reported a 30 per cent boost in business during the rush morning hours. “The road blockades were not a major concern. Experienced drivers know the shortest alternative routes to take passengers to their destinations. “I just don’t want to accidentally enter a protest area and get trapped. The protests have become very fluid. Road barriers could be set up anywhere all of a sudden without any warning,” Leung said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3021528/hong-kong-residents-wake-transport-chaos-suspended-train
Financial Secretary Paul Chan warns that anti-government protests – paired with US-China trade war – could plunge Hong Kong’s economy into recession,"Chan warns economy is losing momentum as estimates of losses from Monday’s protests range from HK$300 million to HK$2.6 billion.; One economist was blunt: ‘In Hong Kong, breaking someone’s rice bowl is unforgivable’","10:27pm, 5 Aug, 2019","Paul Chan Mo-po issued the grave warning as Hong Kong suffered massive flight cancellations, commuter chaos, traffic jams and service disruptions as thousands of people joined the largest citywide strike in decades to protest against the government’s extradition bill crisis.; “Hong Kong’s economy is facing a very difficult situation,” Chan said. “It is facing very big downward pressure as it has to deal with the ongoing US-China trade war and internal challenges at the same time.”; Chan said the anti-extradition movement that has plunged the city into chaos for two months has had an adverse impact on Hong Kong’s economy.; Hong Kong recorded economic growth of 0.6 per cent year-on-year for the second quarter of 2019. Chan argued, however, that on an adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison the GDP had in fact decreased by 0.3 per cent.; Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, director of the ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, argued that if the government was determined to resolve the current political crisis by addressing the grievances and demands of the protesters the city’s economy could easily rebound.; Pang said she did not question the protesters’ movement, but she called on them to consider the economic consequences before taking any drastic action.","Hong Kong’s finance chief on Monday urged protesters to step back from their destabilising actions, warning that the city’s economy could plunge into recession if it continues to be rocked by the global trade war and escalating turmoil in the streets. Economists on Monday gave a wide range of estimates on the economic cost of the day of protests – from HK$300 million to HK$2.6 billion (US$38 million to US$332 million). The US-China trade tensions are worsening again after US President Donald Trump announced a 10 per cent tariff on US$300 billion worth of Chinese goods from September 1, blaming Beijing for not buying enough American farm products. He said: “Many shops, restaurants, and retailers have indicated that their businesses have suffered from the social unrest. As mentioned by the chief executive, some shops have been forced to close down intermittently.” “In other words, Hong Kong’s economy is losing its momentum. It would ‘technically’ fall into economic recession if the negative growth continues in the third quarter,” he said. He also pointed to dropping retail figures, warning that sales in June had already slumped by 6.7 per cent. Chan urged Hongkongers to consider the impact of their movement. “We have listened to the dissatisfaction over our handling of the bill and also our governance. We will listen and communicate more with different sectors and improve ourselves,” he said. “I hope people will think twice as they carry on their movement.” “The government’s inaction has aggravated the confidence crisis by investors who may start to move their investment to somewhere else. This will be a blow to Hong Kong as an international financial centre,” he said. “If the government is willing to address the problems and the legitimate demands from the protesters, which in fact are not something difficult for the government, then Hong Kong’s economy could easily gain momentum.” Iris Pang, an ING Greater China economist, said it was inevitable that the city’s economy, especially the retail sales sector, would suffer as a result of the crisis. “We can see that the protests are getting more frequent and a lot of shops have been forced to close down to avoid them, which may lead to the loss of income and reduction of staff,” she said. “The protesters need to ask themselves two key questions – whether their movement originates from the right mindset, and whether it would affect the livelihoods of ordinary people,” she said. “In Hong Kong, breaking someone’s rice bowl is unforgivable,” Pang said. Kwan estimated the economic loss from Monday’s strike, transport stoppage and street clashes would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s hard to measure. One day’s GDP is about HK$7 billion to HK$8 billion [US$893 million to US$1 billion]. Given that many of them took part in the strike in the form of taking sick leave or holiday, and some may work longer hours tomorrow to make up for the loss of productivity, I estimate that the economic loss will not be more than HK$300 million [US$38 million],” he said. But Pang said given the number of shops that closed, a rough estimate of the economic loss could be about one-third of one day’s GDP based on the latest figures – about HK$2.6 billion (US$332 million).",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021526/financial-secretary-paul-chan-warns-anti-government

Here are some brief excerpts of what she said: OPENING REMARKS “Hong Kong has been the safest city in the world. But this series of extremely violent acts is pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous situation, some extreme activists have altered the nature of these protests.” “They removed the national flag, threw it into the sea, and called for a revolution to liberate Hong Kong. These actions challenged national sovereignty, threatened ‘one country, two systems’, and would destroy the city’s prosperity and stability.” “Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city’s future? Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said was to bring collateral damage, would push Hong Kong onto a path of no return.” “People should respect others’ right to go to work. Blocking roads, stopping people from going to work could cause people to lose their jobs, and many grass roots families would be affected.” Q: Will you, or any member of your cabinet, take responsibility for the social unrest and step down? Lam: “When 7 million people are facing huge challenges, this is no longer about my personal honour. My colleagues and I have the responsibility to stand fast in our positions.” Q: Apart from condemning protesters, what have you done to resolve this crisis? Lam: “I have not stopped meeting different sectors. You might ask why I did not meet the media [in the past two weeks, but] the fact is some radical internet users would storm any even, they know I would be attending, be it open or closed door. “Organisers would not even want me to go now, as they would have to pay a huge sum for insurance. This is Hong Kong today, where people resort to threats and bullying to achieve their goals.” Q: People wanted you to completely withdraw the bill and set up a commission of inquiry. What is stopping you from taking those actions? Lam: “The Independent Police Complaints Council will review the whole saga. Some people may not agree with our response, but we have considered every factor involved and come up with the response that we have made. And this is a very strongly worded response as far as the bill is dead.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021524/no-longer-about-my-personal-honour-carrie-lam-when-asked-if

It comes after the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council – China’s cabinet – last week broke its silence on the protests and violent clashes since June, giving its first media briefing on the city since its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

Another official with knowledge of the situation told the South China Morning Post that Beijing’s position on Hong Kong remained largely unchanged. “Hong Kong will not have the same strategic value to China if the chaos continues. If things come to that, even if the central government wants to save Hong Kong, there is not much it can do,” he said. The Post will carry live coverage of the press conference from 2.30pm.

The office also expressed support for the city’s beleaguered police force in the most unwavering terms, and said it would continue to back the chief executive. While it condemned an attack on the central government’s liaison office and the use of violence by “a small number of radicals”, the HKMAO made a distinction between them and peaceful demonstrators. But violence escalated in Hong Kong over the weekend, and on Sunday, masked protesters in the city’s busy tourist district Tsim Sha Tsui threw the Chinese national flag into Victoria Harbour – an act that again triggered uproar on the mainland.

In her first public appearance in two weeks, Lam also accused protesters of gambling with the lives of 7 million people, and said the city was becoming “unsafe and unstable”. Flanked by eight of her ministers at a 40-minute press conference, the chief executive toughened her stance towards protesters and said she would not accept any of their demands, such as for her to resign. She said the government’s way of taking responsibility was by dealing with the aftermath of its effort to push through the extradition bill, which she suspended on June 15. Lam also insisted the protests were not about her governance or the bill any more, when asked what would she do to calm the social unrest. The chief executive was speaking after at least 73 protesters were arrested amid intense clashes with riot police in Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Causeway Bay over the weekend, as demonstrators also wreaked havoc in at least seven other locations across the city in flash-mob demonstrations. Hong Kong was brought to a standstill on Monday morning, as protesters paralysed the city’s MTR railway system by blocking train doors, in response to calls for people to go on strike. Lam described the besieging of various police stations, the hurling of bricks and petrol bombs over the weekend, as well as the blocking of railway services, as a threat to Hong Kong’s public safety and stability. “Hong Kong has been the safest city in the world,” she said. “But this series of extremely violent acts is pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous situation, some extreme activists have altered the nature of these [protests], resorting to violent means to express their aspirations.” Lam condemned protesters who chanted “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” and threw a Chinese flag into the harbour, after tens of thousands defied a police ban and took part in an unlawful march from Tai Kok Tsui to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday. “These actions challenge national sovereignty, threaten one country, two systems, and will destroy the city’s prosperity and stability,” she said. Lam urged people not to condone violence, no matter how upset they are with her administration. “Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city’s future?” she said, as she fought to hold back tears. “Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said is to bring collateral damage, will push Hong Kong onto a path of no return.” But asked whether she, or any member in her cabinet, would take responsibility for the social unrest and step down, Lam insisted she would not resign, especially when Hong Kong’s future was at stake. “When the well-being of 7 million people is facing huge challenges, this is no longer about my personal honour. My colleagues and I have the responsibility to stand fast to our positions,” she said. Lam was also asked why she would not listen to residents and business groups’ demands for a full withdrawal of the bill, and for a judge-led commission of inquiry into the entire controversy. In response, she only reiterated the legislation was “dead”, and the Independent Police Complaints Council had agreed to look into the police’s use of force against protesters. In a direct appeal to protesters, Lam also warned the strikes breaking out across Hong Kong would damage the livelihoods of working families. “People should respect others’ right to go to work … Blocking roads, stopping people from going to work can cause people to lose their jobs, and many low-income families will be affected, ” she said. At the press conference, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po also urged people to stop protesting, as the city’s economy had been facing a difficult situation against the backdrop of the ongoing US-China trade war and internal instability. He pointed to dropping import, export and retail figures, and warned sales had already slumped by 6.7 per cent in June. “We have listened to the dissatisfaction over our handling of the bill and also our governance. I hope people will think twice as they carry on their movement,” he said. Asked why she appeared to have been hiding from the public over the past two weeks, Lam said there was a risk people might disrupt public events or press conferences she was expected to attend, putting off organisers from hosting her. “Some radical internet users would storm the events they know I would be attending, be it open or closed door,” Lam said. “Even organisers would not want me to go now as they would have to pay a huge sum for insurance. “This is Hong Kong today where people resort to threats and bullying to achieve their goal.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021459/hong-kong-being-dragged-down-path-no-return-says-carrie-lam
Hundreds of flights cancelled leaving travellers facing chaos as citywide strike action hits Hong Kong International Airport,"Air traffic controllers take sick leave en masse, forcing authorities to halve the minimum number of take-offs per hour","10:59am, 5 Aug, 2019","On Monday, Hong Kong media was invited to another briefing, hours after Lam issued a stern warning over the escalating social unrest in the city.; During its 40-minute briefing on Monday last week, the HKMAO made clear that a return to law and order should be the “most pressing priority” for Hong Kong.; Demonstrators are calling for the complete withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to jurisdictions including mainland China, and an independent inquiry into the police’s handling of the protests, among other demands.","A paralysing citywide strike forced Hong Kong airport bosses to cancel some 250 flights on Monday. Air traffic controllers called in sick en masse as part of long-running anti-government protests, joining Hongkongers from more than 20 business sectors, cutting the number of flights that could take off or land. Local airlines bore the brunt of the impact. Cathay Pacific Airways and Cathay Dragon cancelled 140 flights to and from the city, budget carrier HK Express axed 10 services and Hong Kong Airlines pulled 37 flights. Only a handful of foreign carriers cancelled services, while most long-haul flights were preserved. A limited number of Tuesday flights were also affected. Cathay Pacific and Dragon cancelled 14 services on Tuesday, with HK Express delaying seven services and Hong Kong Airlines scrapping the same number. The strike was the latest chapter in protests that have rocked the city for more than two months. Protesters demand the full withdrawal of an unpopular extradition bill, which has already been shelved, and an independent investigation into the government’s handling of the political crisis. The cancelled flights were a blow to the local tourism sector, fuelling concerns that the nine weeks of increasingly violent civil unrest could hit the city’s economy. More than 1,000 passenger flights had been scheduled to depart and arrive in Hong Kong on Monday, with 511 services departing the city, according to the airport authority’s website. As part of the reduction of flights, authorities planned for 34 flights to take off per hour, instead of the usual maximum of 68. For some, just getting to the airport proved a challenge, with protesters causing the Airport Express train service to be briefly suspended and in-town check-in facilities to be halted for the entire day. The Cathay Pacific Group, which comprises its flagship brand and Cathay Dragon, had reduced the number of cabin crew to a minimum to ensure as many flights as possible would take off, as it had recognised a large number of flight attendants and some pilots would call in sick. Newly acquired HK Express is also part of the airline group. Routes with some of the highest frequencies – including Taipei, Shanghai, Beijing, Shanghai, Manila and Singapore – suffered cuts. Tech professional Davis Ng, 45, had his 2.30pm Cathay Pacific flight to Singapore cancelled, and bought a ticket for a Singapore Airlines flight at 8am instead. “I don’t think it is inconvenient for me to change to an earlier flight and to get ready at 5am. The message had already been clear to me that there would be a big strike in Hong Kong today. People understand what the situation is about and the traffic to the airport this morning was quite smooth,” Ng said. Tourist Michelle Marshall, on holiday from England, said her travelling party of four experienced eight days of protests and a typhoon. The group arrived early at the airport for their Cathay Pacific flight to Singapore, avoiding public transport for fear of disruption. “If I’d known in January what was happening in Hong Kong I wouldn’t have booked,” the 53 year-old said. “I don’t want to be stuck here for another 24 hours because we would have nowhere else to go.” In Shanghai, Catherine Ma, a vice-president at a French investment bank, was spared a cancellation on her flight back to the city. “Even if my flight was affected, I wouldn’t mind. All Hongkongers know what’s going on in Hong Kong. Even if Hong Kong keeps striking for another couple of days, I wouldn’t mind,” Ma, who is in her 30s, said. Hongkonger Jat Wu, who works in the hospitality industry, was less understanding. He grew frustrated as he waited for his Shanghai flight back to the city, having had his plans rearranged twice due to the strikes. “I don’t support this strike at all. I have to go back to work tomorrow. If you don’t have family to take care of and your parents feed you no matter what, of course you don’t mind the strike,” the 58 year-old Yuen Long resident said. “I oppose the entire movement as a whole because it’s not getting us anywhere. You see what’s happening in Shanghai, right? Great things are being built. Talents are going there.” The strike hit at the height of the summer, when packed flights generate big profits for airlines, dealing a blow to the publicly listed Cathay Pacific Group. Shares in Hong Kong’s biggest airline, whose large cargo arm is already weathering the effects of the US-China trade war, closed 4.2 per cent down at HK$10.40 a share when the city’s stock exchange closed. The carrier will release its financial results for the first half of 2019 on Wednesday.

The night quiet Hong Kong working-class neighbourhood Wong Tai Sin became a smoking battleground,Residents of Wong Tai Sin joined protesters to vent their anger at police late on Saturday after tear gas was fired in densely packed area to disperse crowds; But police say they were duty bound to go after radical demonstrators who ‘changed their clothes and stirred up trouble’ in the temple district,"9:00am, 5 Aug, 2019","On Saturday night, the usually quiet working-class neighbourhood was rocked by unprecedented violence, with residents up in arms as their streets became smoking battlegrounds – the fumes this time from tear gas rounds fired by riot police against anti-government protesters as well as angry locals objecting to their presence.; After tens of thousands rallied peacefully against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, protesters took over roads in Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui, with the more radical activists targeting the Cross-Harbour Tunnel twice, at around 6pm and 11pm, to choke off a key transport link between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.","Residents of Wong Tai Sin are used to the sight and smell of smoke, but only from the burning of incense at the altars of its famed temple, which, like the district itself, is also named after the Taoist deity whom people pray to for healing. In the middle of the night, police in full riot gear used tear gas, pepper spray and batons to disperse angry crowds outside densely packed residential towers. Police officers ended up retreating in the face of overwhelming public anger as residents joined protesters, many without protective gear to face tear gas, screaming and cursing at them. “Wong Tai Sin does not welcome you, go away!” they shouted. “Do you know we have children at home? Leave now! We don’t want you here!” There were uniquely Hong Kong moments during the violent confrontation, such as when someone extinguished a tear-gas canister using an aluminium dish of the type commonly used to steam fish. And there were ugly scenes as well, including a battle between protesters and residents at the disciplined services quarters, home to police officers’ families. While Wong Tai Sin residents made it abundantly clear police were unwelcome and accused them of bringing conflict to their backyard, Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan insisted officers were duty bound to go after radical protesters who “changed their clothes and stirred up trouble” in the district, starting with an attack on the local police station. The mayhem in Wong Tai Sin capped a day of wider protest chaos in the retail hubs of Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui in the heart of Kowloon. The night descended into chaos as one radical group laid siege to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, throwing a petrol bomb at the front entrance and vandalising more than 20 vehicles in the car park with metal rods, bricks and flammable items. Police fired round after round of tear gas into the crowds in both Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok before a new flashpoint emerged in Wong Tai Sin. The clashes in the temple district began at around 11pm, with reports that police officers had charged into the local MTR station to arrest two people. Hundreds of residents joined protesters to block police vans from leaving the neighbourhood bus terminal and car park near Shatin Pass Road, believing that the suspects were being whisked away. One police van came under a fierce attack, with a protester directing a fire extinguisher at an outnumbered handful of officers trying to fight back with shields, batons and pepper spray while the crowd hurled umbrellas, helmets and other objects at them. Abby Chan, a 30-year-old resident, witnessed some of the flare-ups from her flat 20 floors above the chaos. The protesters started to surround the car park at around 11.30pm, she said, and police tried to set up a line of defence across the road, but were outnumbered by the growing crowd of demonstrators and residents demanding the release of those arrested. Many were in their nightclothes and completely unprepared for tear gas, but ignored police warnings to disperse. Police sources said the first round of tear gas was fired to disperse more than 100 people. Just before 1am, Chan saw a group of people armed with rods rushing out from the disciplined services quarters near the police station, and heard a loud bang. “I smelled the tear gas and it was slightly hurting my eyes, so I quickly closed the window,” she said. Projectiles, including water bottles and glass objects, were seen being thrown down at the crowd from the windows of the building housing the families of police officers. “A gang of violent protesters subsequently surrounded Wong Tai Sin Disciplined Services Quarters, hurling fireworks and numerous miscellaneous objects into the quarters, breaking the glass windows of lower-floor residential units, damaging the gates of the car parks and other government property,” police said later in an official statement. “The safety of the residents was seriously threatened. In the face of the chaotic situation, tear gas was launched to disperse the protesters.” Both protesters and residents who came out of the quarters fought each other with wooden sticks and umbrellas, but the violent confrontation ended after others from the neighbourhood intervened. Sources said police fired a second round of tear gas to stop the two sides from hurling objects at each other and to end more clashes at the car park entrance. Protesters then retreated to Lung Cheung Road, where they set up barricades to block traffic. The clashes and stand-off in Wong Tai Sin lasted until around 4am, when most of the protesters left after more tear gas was used. Wong Tai Sin residents complained the next day about the police action. “They should not have fired tear gas,” witness Chan said. “There were so many residents nearby and some of them were just wearing slippers, with no protective gear. Everyone was just surrounding the police without much violence in the beginning.” Another resident, 34-year-old Cat Lee, said police had “overreacted a bit”. “Do you really have to use tear gas when there are so many residents nearby? Are there no other options?” she said. Ian Yeung, 23, said he could hear the clashes from his 33rd-floor home through closed windows. “The protesters’ behaviour was radical if you single out what happened last night,” he said. “But I found the police’s way of handling them rather unprofessional and inappropriate. They fired in the wrong direction many times, including at journalists and aged-care homes. This should not be the case for police with proper training.” Another resident, who has lived in the disciplined services quarters for about a decade, said: “I know there are some problems with the government, and it is OK to voice your demands, but it should be done rationally.” A police source said officers had seen protesters from the Kowloon rallies changing their clothes, removing their masks and mingling with local residents in Wong Tai Sin to cause further trouble. “They started the confrontation with officers or local residents. We believe they tried to make an ugly scene to criticise police for the use of force in a dense living area,” he said. With both police and their critics sticking to their own side of the story, and with no end in sight to Hong Kong’s protest crisis, the escalating confrontations between law enforcers and members of the public look set to continue.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021387/night-quiet-working-class-neighbourhood-hong-kong-became

Hong Kong police play catch-up as anti-government protesters wreak havoc across the city,"Causeway Bay, Tseung Kwan O and Kwun Tong among array of areas hit, with roads blocked and tear gas fired; Highly organised demonstrators create enough chaos to draw out police before moving on to another target","12:27am, 5 Aug, 2019","On Saturday night, the usually quiet working-class neighbourhood was rocked by unprecedented violence, with residents up in arms as their streets became smoking battlegrounds – the fumes this time from tear gas rounds fired by riot police against anti-government protesters as well as angry locals objecting to their presence.; After tens of thousands rallied peacefully against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, protesters took over roads in Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui, with the more radical activists targeting the Cross-Harbour Tunnel twice, at around 6pm and 11pm, to choke off a key transport link between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.","Tear gas filled the streets of Causeway Bay on Sunday as Hong Kong’s premier shopping district became the latest battleground for repeated clashes between police and anti-government protesters who seized key roads, sparking chaos that continued to spread across the city late into the night. Protesters, many of them young radicals who have declared war on the embattled police force, shut down the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a key link between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, for the second straight day, unleashing traffic bedlam on the eve of a citywide strike that could be even more chaotic, with an expected turnout of half a million. After two hours of tolerating the mayhem they wrought – confronting police and putting up metal and water barricades along the two main traffic arteries running through Causeway Bay and Wan Chai, Hennessy Road and Gloucester Road – riot police swooped in, kicked away the barricades and fired multiple rounds of tear gas. Protesters embarked on a new tactic of advancing and retreating on a moving battlefield that stretched from Tseung Kwan O to Causeway Bay and Kennedy Town and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. Before midnight, they also attacked and vandalised police stations in Kwun Tong and Lam Tin. The method to the mayhem appeared to be creating enough chaos to draw out the police before moving on to another target, leaving the force to play catch-up. In Causeway Bay, they blocked traffic, causing long lines of trams to stall on their tracks, buses packed with passengers to be left on the roads with no route out, and shoppers to quickly leave the potential trouble spots. The protesters overturned bins, two of which were set on fire; some burned wooden planks in a bin and flung it at police lines. After wreaking havoc in Causeway Bay, they went to block the tunnel and then returned to the shopping district. One group splintered off to Wan Chai, heading for Golden Bauhinia Square, a site popular with mainland Chinese tourists, where they spray-painted its eponymous golden statue with the words “The heavens will destroy the Communist Party” and “Liberate Hong Kong”. Some groups returned to Causeway Bay yet again, while others debated moving on to Wong Tai Sin, the scene of pitched battles between police and protesters – as well as residents who turned against the law enforcers – on Saturday night. Protesters also descended on the middle-class neighbourhood of Kwun Tong, while Tseung Kwan O became a flashpoint once again with protesters taking over the roads and confronting police. After midnight, hundreds of protesters and local residents in Wong Tai Sin started gathering near the disciplined services quarters – where emergency service workers live with their families – scene of rancorous exchanges just a day earlier. By 1.30am, police had taken control of the area. But in Mei Foo, hundreds were still occupying roads near the bus terminal. While the force issued one statement after another to condemn the protesters, the government again warned against the “wanton destruction of public peace”. “Such acts have already gone far beyond the limits of peaceful and rational protests which the government and general public will not condone under any circumstances,” it said in a statement. “Otherwise they will push Hong Kong into a very dangerous situation.” Sunday’s protests began in Tseung Kwan O with a peaceful rally and march that soon, in what has become a pattern, descended into violence as groups broke away to deface the police station in the neighbourhood with graffiti and eggs. As riot police warned them off, the crowds dispersed. But later several hundred returned and continued to loiter outside the station well into the evening. Over on Hong Kong Island, police had banned a march for organisers of a rally in Kennedy Town that began at 5pm. But just an hour after the speeches began, crowds took over roads and put up barricades. Police acted swiftly with tear gas, prompting protesters to pile into the MTR station at Kennedy Town to board trains to Causeway Bay. Within half an hour, they occupied the shopping hub’s main roads, causing traffic to seize up and leaving a long line of trams stuck on their tracks, while they put up metal and water barricades they had sequestered from construction sites nearby. Shoppers in the area were taken by surprise by the sudden convergence of masked and helmeted people in black clothes and body armour, but for the most part ceded the roads and pavements to the protesters. After bringing traffic to a halt in Causeway Bay, groups of protesters targeted the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, blocking traffic in both Kowloon- and Hong Kong-bound lanes. They parted to allow some vehicles to pass, including an ambulance flashing its lights. When riot police arrived, the protesters fled, and Kowloon-bound traffic resumed soon after. Their actions followed the Saturday blocking of the tunnel, from the Kowloon side. On Sunday evening, police warned they had incorporated into their arsenal a new portable spraying device that would use edible dye to identify protesters. According to a police video on Facebook, the force was doing so to cope with the increasing number of protests. “When a person is sprayed at a protest site, the colour may stay on his or her clothes or skin. This helps officers identify who was at the scene, if necessary,” the video stated. Sunday’s protests followed Saturday’s scenes of violence in Kowloon in several shopping areas and the neighbourhood of Wong Tai Sin, where residents turned on riot police who used tear gas to disperse them.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021389/hong-kong-police-play-catch-anti-government-protesters
Filipino and South Korean working in Hong Kong arrested in Mong Kok – the first foreigners detained in extradition protests,"Filipino employee of Hong Kong Disneyland and South Korean restaurant worker arrested in Mong Kok on Saturday; Philippine diplomat says man was held for wearing black, while South Korean official urges police for fair probe","10:59pm, 4 Aug, 2019","On Saturday night, the usually quiet working-class neighbourhood was rocked by unprecedented violence, with residents up in arms as their streets became smoking battlegrounds – the fumes this time from tear gas rounds fired by riot police against anti-government protesters as well as angry locals objecting to their presence.; After tens of thousands rallied peacefully against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, protesters took over roads in Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui, with the more radical activists targeting the Cross-Harbour Tunnel twice, at around 6pm and 11pm, to choke off a key transport link between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.","Police detained two foreigners working in Hong Kong while clearing extradition bill protesters in Mong Kok on Saturday, in what is believed to be the first arrest of expats during the demonstrations that have gripped the city since June. One of the men was a 36-year-old Filipino who had been working as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland since 2008, according to a source. Riot police pinned down the man, who was not wearing any protective gear, in Mong Kok at about 11pm. He reportedly tried to explain he was not a protester. But a police source said the man took part in the protest, and had earlier commented on the extradition bill on social media. Hong Kong Disneyland authorities said they would follow up the case. Germinia Aguilar-Usudan, the Philippine deputy consul in Hong Kong, told the media the man was arrested for wearing black while he was on his way to get food. Usudan said the man asked not to be identified because he was worried about the health of his mother. Two Hong Kong lawyers are assisting him pro bono. The other man was a 26-year-old South Korean restaurant worker. A Korean society in the city said the man held a Hong Kong work permit. He was arrested in Mong Kok but detained at the North Point police station. “We have requested that Hong Kong police conduct a fair investigation,” said an official at the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in Hong Kong. A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said in Seoul on Sunday that their consulate in Hong Kong had sent officials to the police station where the man was being held. Around 18,654 South Koreans, including 1,300 students, were living in Hong Kong last year, according to consulate figures. A police spokesman said the foreigners were arrested for unlawful assembly. They were among 24 men and five women arrested on Saturday night.

The airport is expected to reduce flight operations to just one runway from two. Based on estimates, this could mean half of flights on Cathay Pacific Airways, the city’s flag carrier, could be affected, in the most direct blow to travellers, as concerns about the near nine-week anti-government protests gain international attention. More than 1,000 commercial flights were initially due to depart and arrive in Hong Kong on Monday, with 511 services scheduled to leave the city, according to the Airport Authority’s website. The decision by the Civil Aviation Department on Sunday night came amid anonymous air traffic controllers following through on threats to join Monday’s citywide strike. More than 500,000 Hongkongers from over 20 business sectors were expected to join the industrial action, with organisers on Sunday urging all city employees to join the strike to pile more pressure on the city’s embattled administration. Critics of the strike said the large-scale disruption – across industries ranging from finance and aviation to restaurants, green groups and the arts – would be a severe blow to the reputation of Hong Kong, a city that has long prided itself on stability and world-class services. Strike organisers said work stoppages would be held in seven districts – Admiralty, Mong Kok, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Wong Tai Sin, Tuen Mun and outside Hong Kong Disneyland. The activists said their goal was to prevent passengers from reaching work in crucial business districts such as Central, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. They asked the public for tolerance and patience over service delays. Protesters also revealed plans to block harbour tunnels, including the Cross-Harbour Tunnel and Eastern Harbour Crossing, and encircle the bus depots in Kowloon Bay and Lai Chi Kok. Officials with two MTR unions, including the 4,000-strong Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions, and the MTR Corporation Staff Union, which has over 400 members, said they would not ask members to take part in the strike and were not aware of any drivers planning to join the walkout. On Saturday, nine activists, many of them wearing masks, said workers from more than 20 business sectors had already applied for time off to take part in the strike. Representatives of the unions for Citybus and KMB workers said a number of bus drivers would also take sick leave on Monday. Carol Ng Man-yee, chairwoman of pro-democracy Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU), said the labour umbrella group had called for public support of the strike. “This is a citywide strike. Judging from the 1 million turnout for the June 9 march, I reckon the number of people joining the strike might reach 500,000,” Ng said. “I think the absence rate will be very high tomorrow.” “I understand that the airline companies have put a large number of staff on standby because they fear there could be massive delays to flight services and also a large number of flight cancellations,” said Ng, a long-serving flight attendant. More than 20 air traffic controllers from the Civil Aviation Department collectively took sick leave on Sunday, accounting for about one-third of the officers on duty. An official said the department managed to find replacements to avoid disruption. One air traffic controller, who gave his name as Chan, said they hoped their action would motivate more people to join the general strike on Monday. “We want to support young people,” he said. “We know that [the aviation department] has some backup plans in place, so we took our sick leave one day in advance.” The Airport Authority has advised airlines to brace for disruption until about 6am on Tuesday. Its spokesman advised passengers to “check with their airlines for the latest flight information, and to proceed to the airport only when their seats and flight time have been confirmed”. He added that they should keep an eye on announcements from airlines, as well as the authority’s website and mobile app. Cathay Pacific issued similar advice, adding that it recommended customers postpone non-essential travel on Monday. It added that it would waive rebooking and rerouting charges for tickets issued on or before Monday on Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon for arrival or departure on Monday or Tuesday. The Transport Department said it would try to keep traffic smooth and uninterrupted. The department asked the public to watch for the latest traffic news for any service adjustments. “They should plan their journey in advance, consider using alternative routes if necessary, start their journey earlier and allow more time for travelling tomorrow,” the department said. An MTR spokesman called on passengers not to disrupt train services, saying the railway operator would remain flexible on staff deployment to provide smooth services for commuters.

Shortly after 6pm, police warned of a dispersal operation as protesters threw bricks and other items at the force’s compound, breaking multiple windows. But about 10 minutes after the warning, protesters were gone. They later occupied the roads outside the MTR station, about half an hour’s walk from the scene of the stand-off. Police gave the estimate of crowd size at 27,000 at its peak. At 2.30pm on Sunday, a sizeable crowd gathered at Po Tsui Park in the eastern New Territories for a march to Velodrome Park, with attendance surging as the procession advanced. Meanwhile on Hong Kong Island, all eyes were on a 5pm rally in Belcher Bay Park and whether protesters would march to Beijing’s liaison office, which is nearby. Water barricades were placed outside the liaison office, apparently to prevent protesters from storming in. More than 20 police officers stood watch. Protesters’ demands remained largely the same, including the full withdrawal of the now-shelved extradition bill, and an inquiry into police handling of demonstrators. Two hours after the Tseung Kwan O march started, a stream of protesters was still flowing from the starting point of Po Tsui Park to the finishing point of Velodrome Park. Among the throng was Chan Kai-yiu, 50, who had come from Tsing Yi. “The government has not responded to the public’s demands, and seems to not exist any more. Police are also becoming more violent,” he said. “Many people are coming out because they see there is unrighteousness here.” Another protester, surnamed Shek, an artist in his 20s, was at the march with his mother. “[Chief Executive] Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and [police chief] Stephen Lo Wai-chung have given public statements but they have not solved the problem at all,” he said. “We need an effective dialogue between the government and protesters. At the moment they are doing nothing to solve this crisis.” Some of the protesters, including Raymond Mok and Wingo Yeung, said they would join a citywide strike planned for the following day. Mok, aged 35 and an IT professional, said: “Carrie Lam needs to face the citizens and respond to our five demands.” Yeung, a 29-year-old social worker, planned to get back to her office in the morning and make placards with her colleagues before attending a strike rally in Admiralty in the afternoon. Li Sik-kam, a 77-year-old man from Fanling, said protests would continue as long as the government failed to respond to public demands. The elderly man, who has been to some of the previous protests, said it was not hard for him to complete the entire route. “I’ll take some breaks in between,” he said. “I’m fine if I have a cane with me.” As protesters passed Tseung Kwan O Police Station, some hurled insults at officers inside, calling them “rubbish”. Water barricades had been set up to protect the compound, after attacks on stations in other districts. At one point, several officers came out of the station with a police dog when a handful of protesters threw eggs at the building and quickly fled. This was before the second incident when hundreds gathered closer to 6pm to repeat the actions. A protester had sprayed “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” on the station wall. Tensions between the police and the public have flared since June after tear gas and rubber bullets were used on protesters to disperse them, though the force has insisted the crowds have also assaulted officers. Outside Po Lam MTR station, some protesters set up barricades but did not occupy the roads. There was a confrontation after several protesters chased down a man and surrounded him. They were upset after he stared at some of them who were removing roadside railings. Most shops in the nearby Well On Shopping Arcade were closed. Some said they planned to close later in the afternoon while others expressed no intention to do so. Over on Hong Kong Island, Holas Cheung, who owns a hair salon near the venue of a rally in Belcher Bay Park, was putting up posters of support for protesters. “My salon will be on strike tomorrow,” he said. “I’ve seen how much the youngsters on protest front lines have done. Now it’s my turn.” The rally started at 5.30pm and speakers took turns sharing thoughts on the political crisis. Addressing the crowd, high school student Zack Ho said: “I know many of you may feel disappointed now, but please don’t be desperate. I hope you can trust us, the young generation.” George Chu, 40, an engineer who has been attending protests since June, said the most important was for Hong Kong to have universal suffrage. “At least then [the government] would be our own.” Joyce Hui, 25, a clerk who is also a protest regular, said: “People have been saying the period before dawn is particularly dark – and the past two months have been the darkest ever. But I will keep going on regardless of how tired I am.” Meanwhile in Central, dozens of friends and family members packed a room at the Cotton Tree Drive Marriage Registry, where Tong Wai-hung, 38, and Elaine To, 41, tied the knot. Speaking before the wedding ceremony, Tong said he had planned for a private affair involving just seven people. “I never thought we couldn’t get married – even if there was a nuclear explosion, I would still marry her,” Tong said. “We feel really touched.” Hong Kong has been gripped by a spate of protests since June over the hated legislation which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city has no extradition agreement, including mainland China, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021360/thousands-march-tseung-kwan-o-hong-kong-continues-weekend

Eighteen people were injured during the clashes, the Hospital Authority said. Six had been discharged as of Sunday afternoon. After police started dispersing protesters in Mong Kok in the west of Kowloon, where an approved rally at a sports ground had spilled into protests in Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui, the working-class district of Wong Tai Sin, home to the temple devoted to the Taoist deity of the same name, was suddenly transformed into a smoking battlefield in an unexpected turn of events. The organiser of the Mong Kok rally said about 120,000 attended. On Sunday, protests were planned in Tseung Kwan O and the west of Hong Kong Island, both densely populated residential districts. On Saturday night, clashes flared in Wong Tai Sin after reports that the police had arrived to arrest two people. Hundreds blocked police vans from leaving, and attacked outnumbered officers with fire extinguishers, helmets, umbrellas and other objects. At about 10.20pm, some protesters who had ventured to Kowloon City from Mong Kok started to march along Prince Edward Road to Wong Tai Sin Police Station, where reporting room services were soon suspended. Riot police used tear gas, pepper spray and batons in the streets of the densely packed neighbourhood, prompting many residents – some of them, such as elderly, shirtless men, without protective gear – to join the protesters in turning on officers, accusing them of disrupting their community. “Wong Tai Sin does not welcome you, go away!” some of them shouted. At midnight, police raised the black flag, firing tear gas about 10 minutes later. According to police, some protesters also threw objects near the disciplined services quarters, where officers and their families live. At one point, chaos broke out among residents near the services quarters, with people from both sides attacking each other with wooden sticks and umbrellas. The scuffles were soon stopped by other residents. Amid the chaos, a tear-gas canister thrown into the crowd was promptly extinguished using an aluminium dish of the sort commonly used to steam fish. Protesters also besieged Wong Tai Sin Police Station, vandalising its CCTV system, while at the same time, police in Mong Kok continued to fire tear gas at the remaining crowds. The stand-off in Wong Tai Sin lasted until around 4am, with most of the protesters leaving after more rounds of tear gas were fired. During a briefing early on Sunday, police condemned violent protesters and said their behaviour had pushed officers to ultimately disperse the crowd using minimal force. The 20 or so protesters were arrested on suspicion of unlawful assembly, possession of a dangerous weapon and assault. “Radical protesters deliberately spread their violent behaviour to several areas in eastern Kowloon, including residential areas. Besides blocking many main thoroughfares in Kowloon, they were also risking the safety of many innocent citizens,” Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan said. When reporters questioned the police’s use of flashlights which disrupted filming during the protest, Yu said the lights were used for illumination and for identifying protesters in the dark. In a statement, the government vowed to bring the radical protesters to justice. “The government strongly condemns the radical protesters who disregarded the law and order, blatantly breached the public peace, and even challenged national sovereignty. The police will strictly enforce the law. Violent protesters who breached the law should also be brought to justice,” it said. “In addition, protesters were suspected to have deliberately damaged the national flag, breaching the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance.” On Saturday, near the clock tower in Tsim Sha Tsui, four protesters were spotted clambering up a flagstaff to remove the Chinese national flag, which was then flung into the water in Victoria Harbour while tourists took pictures. “We express regret over such behaviour which is illegal and disregards public order and the needs of other members of the public. Indeed, illegal behaviour and road blockages involved in recent protests, held in the name of expression of aspirations, are getting worse and go far beyond the boundary of freedom of expression in a civilised society,” the government statement said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021353/hong-kong-protests-more-20-arrested-after-clashes-tsim-sha

But business leaders have warned the employees of a government and an economic backlash. Protesters were set to launch the strike in eight districts – Admiralty, Mong Kok, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Tsuen Wan, Wong Tai Sin, Tuen Mun and around the theme park Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Police said on Saturday they had received applications for rallies from six districts and issued no-objection letters for Admiralty, Wong Tai Sin and Tuen Mun. Hongkongers have long put work as a priority. But now some people are defying that and supporting the five demands of the anti-extradition movement, including a full withdrawal of the now-abandoned bill and an independent investigation into police’s use of force on the demonstrators. On Saturday, nine people, many of them wearing masks, said in a press conference they had gathered 14,000 locals from more than 20 sectors, and some had already applied for leave to take part in the strike. A spokesman for the strike’s organising committee who gave his name only as Chan, said they were left with no option but to go on strike as the government “did not pay heed to people’s demands”. “Various sectors have expressed their views in most peaceful ways. But, the government did not listen to them,” he said. “A lot of protesters were attacked with violence, and persecuted by a tyranny … When society has become like this, we need to paralyse it temporarily to force the government to face the problems.” At the same event, a person from the insurance industry who identified himself as Poon, said he hoped employers would not punish their workers for taking part in the strike. “Some frontline insurers specialise in clients from mainland China, who trust Hong Kong’s legal system. But the government here has repeatedly challenged our rule of law. I hope the insurers stop meeting their clients for a day and go on strike,” he said. With workers from sectors – such as finance, civil service, education and arts and culture – expected to join the strike, the city, which always prided itself for being efficient and convenient, could see large-scale disruptions on Monday. Earlier, labour unions from five airlines, two in the bus industry and one for the city’s railway called on their members to go on a strike and 33 social services were expected to be suspended as more than 2,000 social welfare workers showed their support to the movement. Police said it was regrettable that some people had called for initiating an uncooperative movement – such as obstructing doors at MTR stations, besieging bus stations and staging clashes in tunnels. “We will have close communication with MTR authorities and enter stations to help maintain order if needed,” a senior superintendent of Kowloon West Regional Headquarters Cheung Wai-wah said. When asked whether anti-riot vehicles armed with water cannons would hit the streets, he said the vehicles had been undergoing road tests and could be deployed if they were considered fit, but only under exceptional circumstances. “There are strict deployment guidelines. Use of the vehicles will be considered only in case of serious casualties, massive road blockages or destruction of public property,” he said. Nearly 40 coffee shops and at least 45 other businesses, including local travel agency Morning Star Travel, would down their shutters on Monday to express their solidarity with the movement. More than 30 programme hosts from two broadcasters – Commercial Radio and the publicly owned RTHK – also gave their backing. Dennis Ng Wang-pun, president of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association, said foreign firms had not lost confidence in Hong Kong, while adding the strike would be unlikely to change the government’s stance. “Do you think the government will kneel down? If I was the government, I would only get tougher. If it compromises because of some radical acts, how can it govern the city?” Ng said on a radio show. Law Ka-chung, chief economist and strategist at the Hong Kong branch of Bank of Communications, said the strike would not have a serious impact on the city’s economy. “Retail may be affected as shops will be closed. But the city’s economy is all about large commercial transactions and infrastructure, which might not be directly hit,” he said. Strikes have been rather rare in Hong Kong. One of those that made headlines was the 2013 Hong Kong dock strike, which lasted 40 days. It was said to have involved about 530 dockers who were unhappy with their employers. Another well-known industrial action was initiated by steel fixers in 2007.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021336/hong-kong-braces-largest-citywide-strike-decades-14000
"Hong Kong protests: chaos rages as Wong Tai Sin residents turn on police for using tear gas in their neighbourhood, following clashes across Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui","Local fury at riot squads after protesters and police trade petrol bombs and tear gas, while off-duty police and families are targeted by radicals; Another day of mass protest sees tens of thousands join approved anti-government march in Kowloon, as well as rival pro-police rally in Hong Kong Island","1:19am, 4 Aug, 2019","The chaos capped off yet another day of mass protests earlier attended by tens of thousands of mostly peaceful demonstrators against the now-abandoned extradition bill. After an approved march had ended, radical groups then besieged Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station while the final battles there and in Mong Kok saw police firing round after round of tear gas at protesters who attacked or fought back with bricks and metal rods.","Hong Kong’s working-class district of Wong Tai Sin was rocked by unprecedented protest violence late on Saturday night, with residents turning on riot police who used tear gas in the streets of the densely packed neighbourhood. The chaos and violence raged on beyond midnight after shopping hubs in the heart of Kowloon became smoking battlefields as defiant anti-government protesters clashed with riot police, having seized control of the streets throughout the day, paralysing traffic and forcing businesses to close early. Tensions flared in Wong Tai Sin, the district that houses the temple devoted to the Taoist deity of the same name, as protesters laid siege to the police station and vandalised the building’s front. When police moved to disperse the protesters, local residents objected, and officers found themselves facing angry crowds, some of whom turned violent. Hundreds then blocked police vans from leaving, claiming arrested protesters were being taken away, and attacked the outnumbered officers, using fire extinguishers, helmets, umbrellas and other objects. Police used pepper spray and waved their batons at protesters and residents alike. Tear gas was fired at the height of the chaos, prompting many to complain that, unlike the protesters, local residents had no protection against the fumes. Late into the night, hardcore protesters in Wong Tai Sin targeted the disciplined services quarters, where off-duty officers and their families lived, with reports of explosives being let off outside the building and objects thrown, breaking windows on the lower floors. Protesters with gas masks, helmets and makeshift weapons, shields and body armour clashed or faced off with fully geared riot police at multiple flare-up points, including Yau Ma Tei, late into the night, while others massed at Wong Tai Sin to vandalise the entrance of the local police station. The police presence looked light during the afternoon as protesters choked the main artery of Nathan Road and its side streets from Mong Kok to Tsim Sha Tsui, and grew more emboldened with their actions as the evening wore on. Police sprang a surprise at around 9.30pm, emerging in full riot gear with shields and batons from both stations to move in on the protesters swiftly after putting up a black final-warning flag. They fired multiple rounds of tear gas and arrested groups of them, many of whom fought back. After the first charge of the Special Tactical Squad, also known as the Raptors, protesters threw petrol bombs that landed some distance away from the police line. Earlier, throughout the afternoon, protesters roamed the streets of the usually bustling retail hub with police keeping a mostly hands-off approach, and blocked the Cross-Harbour Tunnel temporarily with water-filled barricades they had emptied, as Hong Kong lurched into its third month of anti-government demonstrations with no resolution in sight. The slogans they chanted went beyond the extradition bill, the dominant one being: “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.” Many in the crowds also called for others to join citywide strikes on Monday, chanting, “Monday! Go on strike!” “To take Nathan Road is a gesture to show to the government how many people actually came out today – it’s people’s power,” protester Martin Pang said. A large group besieged Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, defacing the walls with graffiti and starting a fire outside its gates. They also used slings to lob bricks over the wall at parked cars in the station premises and pointed laser beams at the officers inside, all the while shouting expletives. Police closed their reporting room services – where people seeking the force’s help in person are received – at the Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hung Hom and Yau Ma Tei stations. On the ground, though, officers were barely visible at first when protesters began gathering in the playground in Mong Kok for their rally. Organisers said 120,000 people took part; police estimated there were only 4,200 participants. What began as a peaceful assembly, however, soon descended into mayhem as marchers departed from their approved route and split in different directions. Ribbon-like columns of black-shirted protesters, kitted out in helmets, masks and goggles, snaked southwards from Mong Kok towards Yau Ma Tei, Jordan and then Tsim Sha Tsui. More than half the shops along the route were shuttered as tourists gaped at the spectacle of demonstrators gathering metal fences to put up barricades at different streets in Mong Kok, a bastion protest site of the 2014 Occupy movement. In Tsim Sha Tsui, near the clock tower, four protesters were spotted clambering up the flagstaff to remove the Chinese flag, which they flung into the harbour while tourists took pictures. Nathan Road soon came to a standstill and protesters marched on towards the tunnel near Polytechnic University. Groups of them quickly emptied water barricades separating the two-way traffic and hauled them, along with metal fences, to block vehicles on both sides. Traffic seized up for more than an hour, before protesters retreated as word spread that police were coming after them. Protesters then drifted back to Mong Kok, some taking a break for dinner, while others appeared to be assessing where they ought to go next. The protesters were communicating verbally or in secret chat groups. The usually crowded streets of Mong Kok, which would have been packed with diners and shoppers on a typical Saturday evening, were ceded over to them. Several streets were barricaded with makeshift metal fences. At the junction of Waterloo and Nathan Road, protesters mounted bamboo poles from dismantled scaffolding as barricades and at least one street had plastic wrap spread across a part of the street to block users. There was talk that police might deploy their latest anti-riot acquisition – water cannon trucks – after one such vehicle was seen on a road in Fanling out for testing. A spokesman said there were strict guidelines for the trucks’ use and that they would only be deployed if there were “serious casualties, massive road blockage or destruction of public property”. Past midnight, the government issued a statement condemning protesters who “deliberately undermine social peace and even challenge national sovereignty”. It accused protesters of destroying the national flag and violating the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance. After 1am on Sunday, police said in a webcast that the Wong Tai Sin crowd had destroyed public property and threatened the safety of residents. The force urged protesters to disperse immediately. By 2am, groups of police were still stationed in the area but protesters had mostly cleared the scene, as with the stand-offs in Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui. Shops in the affected areas suffered from smaller takings because of the protests. A 75-year-old owner of a Mong Kok tuck shop, who wanted to be known only as Tse, said: “Once the hawkers heard about the protest, they packed away all the stalls. In the past 20 years, I’ve never seen the street so empty.” He only made HK$7,000 (US$894) last month, he said, but needed to pay HK$8,000 for rent and around HK$2,000 more for electricity. Also on Saturday, thousands of people showed their solidarity for police after Beijing gave a strong vote of confidence to the embattled force over the protest crisis. The pro-establishment political group Politihk Social Strategic, which organised the rally, estimated 90,000 people attended the event themed “Give Peace A Chance” at the Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, while police put the figure at 26,000 at its peak. The event came a day after Chinese state media ran interviews with three representatives of Hong Kong police unions, who insisted that the local force was able to handle the protests rocking the city and had so far used only minimal force. The rally was reported by the state broadcaster CCTV in its evening news cast, which said the event was “peacefully conducted with music” and featured several interviews of participants who spoke Mandarin. Another day of protests is expected on Sunday, with a march and rally planned for Tseung Kwan O and a gathering in Kennedy Town.

After an approved march had ended, radical groups then besieged Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station while the final battles there and in Mong Kok saw police firing round after round of tear gas at protesters who attacked or fought back with bricks and metal rods.","Many shops in Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui closed early on Saturday, while residents were urged to stay indoors as protesters converged on their neighbourhood. Early in the afternoon, big malls in the area also began closing. Langham Place Shopping Mall was shuttered and further along Nathan Road – the main artery of Kowloon’s shopping district – Wing On Department Store in Yau Ma Tei was also closed. Sometime later, Lane Shoppers Boulevard in Tsim Sha Tsui followed suit. By late afternoon, more than half of the street-level shops along Nathan Road, from Yau Ma Tei to Tsim Sha Tsui, had closed. At Tai Kok Tsui in Mong Kok, near the rally site, the owner of a construction materials shop who wanted to be known only as Chan, closed his shop at about 4pm. “I am worried about my employees’ safety,” he said. Another shopkeeper, surnamed Law, also said police had issued a notice to shopkeepers in the area, advising them to close on Saturday. But Simon Chau, who is in his seventies and owns a snack shop just across the road from Anchor Street Playground, said just before the rally the neighbourhood was quiet as usual, and he was not too worried about being affected by the protests. “People will come to buy food and drinks. And if things get chaotic, I can always shut the shop,” he said. Ng, who runs a bakery on Anchor Street, also said she would be ready to close her shop if violence broke out. But she said she was not too worried as her shop was not on the official route of the rally. “I’ve seen people walking by. But hopefully, this area will remain peaceful,” she said. Kenny Wong, whose domestic worker employment agency sits on Cherry Street across the end point of the march in Mong Kok, was about to close his shop after he heard about the protest route. “I support the right to march peacefully, but just don’t get violent,” he said. Small businesses have reported a drop in sales since the protests began in June, though few in the area were willing to give details. On the usually bustling Tung Choi Street – also known as Ladies’ Street, a market for cheap clothing, accessories, cosmetics and other products – all the hawkers were gone. Half of the shops on both sides of the street also closed early. A 75-year-old snack shop owner, who wanted to be known only as Tse, said: “Once the hawkers heard about the protest, they packed away all the stalls. In the past 20 years, I’ve never seen the street so empty.” He also said his business had been hit hard since a wave of anti-government protests – stemming from the now-shelved extradition bill – started in June. The proposed legislation would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including mainland China, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial. Tse said he made HK$7,000 (US$894) last month, but his monthly rent was HK$8,000 and his electricity bill was around HK$2,000. Security was tight at Greenfield Garden, a residential complex on Palm Street in Tai Kok Tsui, where a notice was put up asking people not to observe the rally from public areas on the premises. It said the building’s doors would also be locked, and a password would be needed to enter the complex. Meanwhile, an employee at a nearby aged-care home said police had warned staff the residents could be affected by the rally. “We will close our windows and we won’t let anyone to leave the premises from noon,” she said. It was business as usual in Olympian City 2 in Tai Kok Tsui, however, where the shops remained open. Visitors were also affected. Nasa, a 42-year-old Malaysian academic, said he wanted to explore Tsim Sha Tsui before he headed to the airport after a three-day stay in the city to attend a conference, but he decided to leave early because of the protests. “I am leaving because I don’t want to be trapped,” he said, pointing to the police officers in the area. “But it’s OK to protest, as long as it is peaceful and no one gets hurt.” Additional reporting by Gigi Choy and Sarah Zheng",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021324/shops-down-shutters-early-and-residents-stay-put-anti
Hong Kong protests: how the city’s Reddit-like forum LIHKG has become the leading platform for organising demonstrations,Protesters use LIHKG to call for backup or request supplies for those on the front lines of clashes with police; The forum used to maintain spirits among the protest camp also has a dark side and is fertile ground for exposing police officers’ personal information,"12:00pm, 3 Aug, 2019","The chaos capped off yet another day of mass protests earlier attended by tens of thousands of mostly peaceful demonstrators against the now-abandoned extradition bill. After an approved march had ended, radical groups then besieged Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station while the final battles there and in Mong Kok saw police firing round after round of tear gas at protesters who attacked or fought back with bricks and metal rods.","A post on the popular Hong Kong forum LIHKG calls on residents to skip work and classes to support a strike by civil servants and MTR staff and put pressure on the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. Written in Cantonese by an extradition bill protester last Monday, the post quickly garnered more than 11,000 upvotes from netizens supporting the movement that has been shaking Hong Kong for two months. Another post appeared to call for a citywide strike on Monday. “Skip work, you may lose your job. But if you don’t skip work, you will lose Hong Kong and your home! Freedom is not free, I beg you, let’s recover Hong Kong,” it read. The forum, dubbed ‘Hong Kong Reddit’, has emerged as one of the virtual command centres of the apparently leaderless movement against the now-shelved bill that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives from Hong Kong to jurisdictions it lacks an existing arrangement with, including mainland China. Ongoing discussions on the forum include where to buy equipment for protests and messages of encouragement to keep fighting. City Weekend explores why LIHKG is so popular in Hong Kong, how the online platform has evolved over the years and how it ended up becoming one of the leading social media platforms for Hong Kong’s protests. What is LIHKG? Established in 2016, LIHKG is a news forum site based in Hong Kong. The site was formed by the creators of the now-defunct forum HKG+, which used to be affiliated as a third-party application with another local forum site HKGolden. After HKG+ was banned by HKGolden in the same year, LIHKG surged in popularity and replaced HKGolden as the go-to site for Hongkongers to discuss political content. LIHKG is often compared to Reddit, an American forum site where users create threads and submit a variety of content through relevant subreddits that categorise the posts into different sections. LIHKG has similar subforums with specific topics related to food, technology, dating and more. Unlike Reddit, Hongkongers generally prefer to stick to LIHKG as posts are predominantly in their native tongue, Cantonese. The city’s subreddit, r/HongKong consists of about 90,000 subscribers who are mainly expatriates, tourists or locals comfortable in English. Since the extradition bill crisis, the sub-reddit sometimes reposts translated information from LIHKG for non-Chinese speakers. How did LIHKG become the main platform for the anti-extradition movement? Protesters are able to use LIHKG to call more people to the streets and request supplies to aid those on the front lines. “If I get there at 7pm, will it be too late?” asks one poster to the rallying call. “No it won’t, we really need people on the streets,” another replies. Threads can be voted up or down by other community members. They can potentially gain hundreds or thousands of upvotes and comments, making them more likely to appear on the forum’s front page. Although LIHKG is mainly local, users may try to spread what they have shared through LIHKG to international audiences. A user once created a thread which urged others to translate memes and share them on popular Reddit meme channels. Some of these memes appeared on highly frequented subreddits such as r/dankmemes and r/funny. The forum is also used for crowdfunding, such as backing a bid for world leaders to address the extradition bill crisis during the G20 Summit. On June 25, open letters written by protesters were advertised in newspapers including the Financial Times and The New York Times. Thanks to the influence of LIHKG, almost HK$5.5 million (US$700,000) was raised by 22,066 activists, 82 per cent more than the targeted amount. How can users stay anonymous on LIHKG? LIHKG is a safe haven for people who may fear speaking up in real life, but still want to call for freedoms and remain politically active. An account can only be created with an email address provided by an internet service provider or higher education institution, meaning the user cannot hide their identity from LIHKG. However, the forum does not require users to reveal any personal information, including their names, so they can remain anonymous. The authorities could still try and get this information through a search warrant. Many still feel this is a safer alternative to HKGolden, especially after its site administrators were forced to hand over the IP address of a 23-year-old user to the authorities. The user had made posts encouraging people to attack police and block MTR stations during the pro-democracy Occupy movement of 2014. While HKGolden was the main forum used during Occupy, it has since limited political content on its site, causing users to gravitate to LIHKG. Are there any risks to using LIHKG? Many popular websites supported by Cloudflare, including LIHKG, shut down mysteriously on July 2, a day after Hong Kong’s legislature was stormed and trashed by protesters. Cyberattacks from mainland China were initially thought to be behind the outages, but Cloudflare has since clarified they were due to an internal issue. Administrators created a Twitter account the day after as an alternative way for users to access LIHKG content. More radical methods of protest can also divide LIHKG users. Before a 15-hour siege of police headquarters in Wan Chai on June 21, there were arguments against storming into the station. “We could lose everything if we storm in. Let’s protect ourselves and not create rifts between us. Stay calm,” one post read. Another said: “We need to minimise the impact on civilians to avoid losing public support.” LIHKG is also fertile ground for doxxing people not supportive of the movement against the extradition bill. One police officer found himself a target of public mockery when his name and picture were leaked, along with private Tinder conversations requesting sexual favours in a police station. Printouts of the conversations were later displayed on multiple so-called Lennon Walls, colourful collages of Post-it notes with messages that have sprung up all over Hong Kong. LIHKG has also enhanced a sense of community among Hongkongers. For example, the phrase “Be water, my friend”, originally said by martial arts legend Bruce Lee, has become a mantra for protesters, who have taken a fluid approach to their rallies.

He sees social standing as another fault line in the ethnic minority community: the wealthy and educated become part of the establishment, sitting on government boards and being appointed to public institutions.","When Bonnie Dhaliwal, a fourth-generation Hongkonger of Indian descent, saw the shocking violence of white-clad men attacking railway passengers in Yuen Long on July 21, she decided she could no longer stay silent. The following week, the 21-year-old graduate joined her mother and other ethnic minority residents in their own demonstration against the vicious attack. The rally took place on July 28 outside the Wan Chai MTR station. About a dozen demonstrators, mostly ethnic minority members, held placards and handed out leaflets and flowers, sharing a messages of love and acceptance. “I’ve never seen Hong Kong in a state like this. It breaks my heart,” says Dhaliwal. “Hong Kong is, and will always be, my home.” Hong Kong has been rocked by months of protests against the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed for the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions where the city has no handover agreements, notably mainland China. The ongoing demonstrations have morphed into a full-fledged governance crisis, with calls for wide-ranging political reforms, including the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent inquiry into police conduct at the protests. The bill saga has polarised the city. Rival pro-police and anti-bill rallies have drawn huge crowds, and there have been frequent conflicts between the two camps on social media and even in the streets. A social worker said ethnic minority communities were also deeply divided by the recent protests, mirroring the rift in Hong Kong society as a whole. The ethnic minority social worker said the division was most evident between older family members – who came to Hong Kong for a more stable life – and the younger generation, who have a strong sense of belonging to the city and consider it their duty to safeguard its future. The younger members of the community also tend to believe that uniting with other young Hongkongers could help facilitate understanding and help fight against the racial discrimination that their seniors might have had to put up with. “Like the rest of Hong Kong, the older members in our community tend to hold more conservative views. [They] think the government is always right and believe in the virtues of stability and harmony, but that is also because many first-generation migrants fled from a chaotic country,” said Jeffrey Andrews, 33, of Indian origin and the first ethnic minority social worker in the city. “But the young have no memory of that. They were born and bred here, have studied and worked here, and developed a sense of belonging to this place, so they usually take a more active part in the protests.” Andrews said protesting could be a more risky business for ethnic minority members, citing his own experience with discrimination. “We are used to being racially profiled by the local police, and that could make us an easy target at the protests due to our visibility. That’s why our parents are especially worried.” According to 2016 government figures, there were 584,383 ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong, making up 8 per cent of the total population. Between 2013 and 2018, there were 397 complaints lodged under the Race Discrimination Ordinance with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the city’s equality watchdog. In Dhaliwal’s family, her 15-year-old sister firmly supported the anti-bill protests. But Dhaliwal, the second oldest of four siblings, and her mother disagreed. At times, there were lively – even heated – discussions at the family dinner table. “My younger sister believes the protesters have tried this peacefully before, but the government doesn’t give in to their demands. So they have to try more violent means – but my mum and I disagree.” Dhaliwal’s mother did not want her daughters to be involved in political movements. But because the teenage sister insisted on joining the protesters, the three women went together on June 12 when demonstrators besieged the Legislative Council in Admiralty. They brought water and supplies to the protesters, chanted slogans and waved placards. They left before police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. “After that day, my mum told us not to go any more because she thought it could be dangerous, and my sister was quite upset about it,” Dhaliwal says. The July 21 attack in Yuen Long was when politics caught up with them – and united the family. It was when a group of men with sticks and metal rods stormed the Yuen Long MTR station and attacked commuters, appearing to target protesters in black who were returning from a march – but also assaulting regular passengers.  At least 45 people were injured and 12 arrested over the incident. The attack, suspected to be carried out by triad gangs, was seen as retaliation against protesters who had occupied streets and disrupted businesses. Messages also circulated online alleging that South Asian people were involved in the attack – leading to outbreaks of discrimination, especially to those ethnic minorities living in Yuen Long. Many members of the community were forced to close their shops or skip work – and some locked themselves at home. Like other ethnic minority members in the city, they stayed quiet and laid low for many weeks. Dhaliwal said she was pained to see widening rifts in ethnic communities, especially after the Yuen Long attack and that was why she joined the anti-violence demonstration in Wan Chai. “I know I may risk recrimination and discrimination, but I need to come out and make a stand against violence,” she said. “I am not anti-police or anti-protesters because I think the police officers are just doing their jobs, and I sympathise with some of the demands of the protesters. But I make no apologies about standing against violence,” says Dhaliwal. “A 23-year-old young man from an elite Indian family recently approached me online. [He] started off by asking me why the protesters are so violent and what have I got against China and Hong Kong? I told him why don’t you come down to the protests and see for yourself,” Andrews says. “He came and he saw the smoke bombs and the tear gas, and now he’s changed his mind. [He] keeps asking me, when’s the next protest?” The man’s parents, however, do not want him at the protests. “I got a call from his older sister asking where he is and when he would return home. I said, don’t dodge your family’s call and you have to keep yourself safe.” Andrews, who speaks fluent Cantonese, said he sees a silver lining for ethnic minorities and believes the recent protests had brought them closer to the local community. “Many Chinese Hongkongers left supportive messages on the protest pictures I posted online, saying they were deeply moved by our solidarity and thanking us for standing shoulder to shoulder with them,” Andrews says. “Another person said we are better than the new arrivals from mainland China, we are the real Hongkongers. I am hopeful that racial discrimination will become less frequent and serious in the future.” Puja Kapai, an associate law professor at Hong Kong University, said ethnic minorities in the city are politically engaged. “Language and cultural barriers have been holding us back. We have been limited in our ability to speak out, because we don’t have access to information in our language, let alone good and accurate information,” she says. Kapai offers her legal expertise at information sessions for ethnic minority members, teaching them about lawful assembly and their rights if they are arrested. “After knowing the legal dimension of the [extradition] bill, they are actually quite concerned because they have seen how [mainland] China has treated its ethnic groups.” A 2016 survey conducted by two NGOs estimated that only 55 per cent of the eligible ethnic minority voters have registered, lower than the overall rate of 73.5 per cent in the city. But Andrews said he believes the situation could soon improve, as the recent protests have become a political awakening for many South Asians in Hong Kong. “I’ve sent out messages on Facebook to people I know asking them to register, and more than 100 of them told me they have [registered] recently. They are realising the importance of taking part in the political conversation if they are serious about the city’s future,” he says. Andrews said his community was keen to make their voice heard in district council election in November. “Even older people have asked me who to vote for. I feel encouraged by the growing awareness, and proud of being Hongkongers who are exercising our rights.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021266/how-hong-kong-ethnic-minority-families-divided-extradition
Hongkongers scout properties in Malaysia as political turmoil rumbles on,"As interest starts to swirl in the property sector, the local education system is also seen as a beneficiary from the unrest in the city; ‘I have heard that there has been an increase in property visits to Malaysia by Hong Kong tourists’, a property agent said","7:00am, 3 Aug, 2019","The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong have resulted in a spike in interest in Malaysian property and private international school enquiries.; Street demonstrations have rocked Hong Kong of late. The now-abandoned extradition bill, which revolved around extraditing alleged criminals to China for trial, caused unhappiness that has evolved into pro-democracy violence on the streets, in the airport and on the public train transport system.; It was also reported recently that people from Hong Kong are increasingly seeking out properties in Singapore.; This story originally appeared on The Star Online","A check with four property consultancies and a couple of international schools suggest that interest rose towards late June and early July this year. SK Brothers Realty (M) Sdn Bhd general manager Chan Ai Cheng said there has been growing interest in Malaysian properties from Hong Kong investors. “The interest is growing and I have heard that there has been an increase in property visits to Malaysia by Hong Kong tourists,” she said. “Malaysia is certainly one of the countries on their list as an investment destination and there are a number of reasons for that. They feel that our property is of decent value and also very affordable. “Culturally, they also feel comfortable with our environment.” Chan added that language is also not a barrier to investors from Hong Kong. “In Malaysia, speaking English, Cantonese and Mandarin is an appealing trait,” she said. “They also like our country for the educational facilities and amenities. We have a number of good international schools here. “Another attractive quality is the food. So, it’s not surprising why many choose Malaysia as an ideal place to invest or even stay.” A check with property developer Sheng Tai International Sdn Bhd, which has been organising “property tourism” trips to Malaysia in the last two to three years, showed that there has been “more interest” in its properties starting June, a staff said, requesting anonymity. As interest starts to swirl in the property sector, the local education system is also seen as a beneficiary from the ongoing turmoil in Hong Kong. A private international school that offers Australian and British education in Malaysia said it has noticed a spike in enquiries for its Australian intake, which begins in January 2020. The British syllabus trimester begins in August. The source said that it did not have many students from Hong Kong before the street demonstrations and is uncertain if the enquiries would result in registrations. “Interest centres on primary school and below, for children aged three to 11 years old, ” the source, who is involved in the Australian syllabus, said. Interest in Australian education started coming in early July. Another education source said her school saw a spike in enquiries in late June and early July. Property consultancy Rahim & Co said the ongoing public demonstration and violence is “likely” to spur more interest here, as Malaysia is already known as “a good value option”. Malaysian properties cost a fraction of those in Hong Kong and come with a larger space. A tourist considering a Malaysian purchase said it is common for an entire family to live in a 500 sqft space, considered a shoebox sized unit in Hong Kong. VPC Alliance Kuala Lumpur managing director James Wong said more Hong Kong people would be buying property in Malaysia to retire or as their second home under the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) programme. “The Hong Kong people have a general tendency to migrate to Canada, Australia and New Zealand rather than to Malaysia. Some may consider buying and living in Malaysia but no strong buying wave is expected, as Malaysian immigration laws for emigration are strict, ” Wong said in an email. Guidelines for foreigners to purchase property in Malaysia need to be further relaxed, including state governments, to remove the price threshold for foreigners to purchase property in Malaysia and for further relaxation of the MM2H, said Wong. Singapore property developer CapitaLand’s joint-venture residential project with Malaysia’s ParkCity Group in Kuala Lumpur achieved strong sales during its priority sales launch over the weekend of July 27 and 28. The 505-unit development, called Park Regent, saw more than 353 units (70 per cent) being sold at an average selling price of 1,100 ringitt per square foot. CapitaLand is one of Asia’s largest diversified groups. The development is located in Desa ParkCity, Kuala Lumpur, and comprises six flat types of one- to four-bedroom units. Prices start from 860,000 ringitt, and units range from 872 sq ft for a one-bedder to 4,887 sq ft for a four-bedder. About 80 per cent of buyers are Malaysians.

China’s ambassador to US blames ‘ill-intentioned’ external forces for Hong Kong protests,"Cui Tiankai says some in the West seek to use the unrest as ‘a bridgehead to attack the mainland’s system’; Cui does not name the US directly, but follows other Beijing officials who accuse Western countries of ‘fanning the fires’","5:00am, 3 Aug, 2019","The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong have resulted in a spike in interest in Malaysian property and private international school enquiries.; Street demonstrations have rocked Hong Kong of late. The now-abandoned extradition bill, which revolved around extraditing alleged criminals to China for trial, caused unhappiness that has evolved into pro-democracy violence on the streets, in the airport and on the public train transport system.; It was also reported recently that people from Hong Kong are increasingly seeking out properties in Singapore.; This story originally appeared on The Star Online","China’s ambassador to the US has echoed the accusations of his boss and other Beijing-aligned officials that anti-China forces outside the country are behind the unrest plaguing Hong Kong for two months. “The biggest peril for ‘one country, two systems’ comes from ill-intentioned forces, both inside and outside Hong Kong, who seek to turn the [special administrative region] into a bridgehead to attack the mainland's system and spark chaos across China,” ambassador Cui Tiankai said in an opinion piece published by Newsweek, referring to the guiding principle of mainland China’s relationship with the city. “For them, the well-being of Hong Kong's 7 million people is a disposable pawn in their strategy. The last thing these people want to see is the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Hong Kong compatriots included.” Cui, 66, who has served as ambassador to Washington since 2013, did not accuse the US directly, instead blaming “some Western politicians” for stirring discontent sparked initially by the Hong Kong government’s attempt to push a controversial extradition bill through the city’s Legislative Council. Cui’s column came a day after China’s top diplomat. Yang Jiechi. accused the US and other Western countries of “fanning the fires” of unrest in Hong Kong by supporting “violent radicals” who seek to destabilise the city. On Wednesday, former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa – now a vice-chairman of China's top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – blamed the US and Taiwan for serving as the “masterminds” of the city’s unrest. Cui’s piece also stressed the importance of “one country” over “two systems”, since the 1997 handover of the former British colony to Beijing. “Any talk about the ‘two systems’ out of the context of ‘one country’ would be illegitimate, and to question the necessity of upholding ‘one country’ with the exercise of ‘two systems’ constitutes a challenge to China's sovereignty,” Cui said. Under one country, two systems, Hong Kong was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy after it was handed over from British. It states that the city’s “capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years”. The proposed legislation that spurred the continuing uproar in Hong Kong would permit extraditing fugitives to any jurisdiction with which the special administrative region of China did not have an extradition agreement, including mainland China. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has suspended the bill, but has refused to withdraw it. The ambassador’s column labelled protesters “radicals”, citing the damage caused when they broke into Hong Kong’s legislative chambers last month, but did not mention an apparently coordinated attack on protesters, journalists and passers-by at a railway station in the city’s northeastern district of Yuen Long two weeks ago. That rampage left 45 people injured. “Look at the radicals in Hong Kong who broke into and vandalised the Legislative Council, beat and maimed the policemen, and illegally stored dangerous assault weapons,” Cui said. “They even stormed the liaison office of the central government and defaced the national emblem. “Were the US to witness a similar assault to its stability, there would undoubtedly be an attempt to restore order.” Official comments from the administration of US President Donald Trump about the unrest in Hong Kong have varied. Asked whether he was concerned by media reports that Beijing might intervene in Hong Kong, Trump said on Thursday that the city had experienced “riots for a long period of time”. “And I don’t know what China’s attitude is,” Trump added. “Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that. But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China. Hong Kong is a part of China, they’ll have to deal with that themselves.” Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a more critical tone. Speaking about the issue at an event in Thailand on Friday, Pompeo said the US “believes in human rights and freedom”. “The current unrest in Hong Kong clearly shows that the will and the voice of the governed will always be heard,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021287/chinas-envoy-us-blames-ill-intentioned-external-forces-hong
Hong Kong civil servants embarrass government with protest against extradition bill and determination to ‘stand together with citizens’,"Thousands of government workers call on embattled employer to meet protesters’ demands over extradition bill crisis; Many dismiss notions of political neutrality, one saying: ‘If we chose to stay silent, we will be betraying our duty and the people’s trust’","12:30am, 3 Aug, 2019","The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong have resulted in a spike in interest in Malaysian property and private international school enquiries.; Street demonstrations have rocked Hong Kong of late. The now-abandoned extradition bill, which revolved around extraditing alleged criminals to China for trial, caused unhappiness that has evolved into pro-democracy violence on the streets, in the airport and on the public train transport system.; It was also reported recently that people from Hong Kong are increasingly seeking out properties in Singapore.; This story originally appeared on The Star Online","Hong Kong civil servants risked the wrath of their embarrassed employer on Friday night as they gathered for an unprecedented rally in the city’s business district and called on the embattled government to meet protesters’ demands over the raging extradition bill turmoil. Flanked by thousands of ordinary Hongkongers, the government employees’ protest went ahead despite – just hours earlier – the city’s second-highest official, Mathew Cheung Kin-chung, urging those on the public payroll not to “do things in contrast with the government’s views”. But those who turned up at the Chater Garden rally said they were undeterred and had joined the protest in their personal capacity and on their free time. Cheung Ka-po, one of the rally organisers, said their participation would not compromise their professionalism. “As our society is approaching the brink of collapse, civil servants and other social sectors have voiced our concerns,” said Cheung, an officer at the Transport Department. “In the face of right and wrong, if we chose to stay silent, we will be betraying our duty and the people’s trust.” He called on the government to formally withdraw the now-shelved bill and to launch an independent inquiry into the political storm. “Only in this way can our society walk out of grief and reconcile,” he said. Organisers said 40,000 people attended the rally, but police estimated the crowd’s size at 13,000 at its peak. The event lasted nearly three hours and spilled onto nearby Jackson and Chater roads and halted traffic leaving Central. It featured speeches from former civil servants as well as pro-democracy lawmakers who repeated demands for a commission of inquiry on the police force’s actions. “Keep it up, civil servants,” the participants chanted, waving their lit mobile phones. Later, umbrellas went up as the rain came down – but the crowds stayed on. A festive atmosphere prevailed, even as many demonstrators appeared irritated with the government’s stern reminder on Thursday that civil servants were to stay politically neutral and “totally loyal” to the chief executive and the government. Groups waved placards that read, “Political neutrality does not mean lacking a conscience”. A civil servant who said he worked for the Hong Kong Observatory was adamant. He said he was not compromising his political neutrality by attending the rally because he felt he should be loyal to the people, not Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. “If the rally was to support the government and the police, would the government criticise us for breaching political neutrality?” said the civil servant with 15 years of experience. He continued: “I found it really odd that they asked us to be loyal to Carrie Lam and her administration. We signed an employment contract with the government. What we serve should be the people, instead of Carrie Lam. Should we carry out a task if we know it’s unjust and unreasonable?” Two 25-year-old civil servants from the Home Affairs Department – who appeared in masks – said they had the right to protest, something that should not be denied them “just because of our jobs”. Ngan Mo-chau, a co-organiser of the rally and an assistant labour director, said the huge turnout of civil servants from 13 bureaus “echoed our rally theme, which says civil servants should stand together with citizens”. Public administration scholar John Burns said the event showed that the government had “succeeded in fracturing a core institution of Hong Kong”. “Our political leaders demonstrate again their incompetence. The government has squandered the community’s goodwill,” he said. On their need to be politically neutral, he said: “Let’s dispense with the civil service’s polite fiction that it is neutral. It enthusiastically supports the interests of the business elite, especially the property developers, in Hong Kong against the interests of the rest of us.” Several civil servants said they were going on personal leave to take part in Monday’s planned citywide strike, which could involve at least seven rallies across Hong Kong with scores of sectors taking part. Less than 2km (1.2 miles) away in Edinburgh Place, medical workers held their own rally on Friday night. Organisers said 10,000 people attended, while the police put the peak number at 1,300. The two rallies kicked off a weekend of protests set for Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. On Saturday, protesters will march in Mong Kok after police gave their 11th-hour approval on Friday night as organisers changed the route. Police supporters, meanwhile, will meet at Victoria Park the same afternoon, with the rural powerhouse Heung Yee Kuk urging village leaders to join the rally. On Sunday, rallies are planned at Tseung Kwan O and Sai Wan. Friday’s two rallies were peaceful, but the night did not end quietly. Protesters attacked the Ma On Shan police station, where the founder of the banned pro-independence Hong Kong National Party and seven others had been detained since Thursday night. The eight were arrested for possession of offensive weapons. Their supporters besieged the station, defacing it with graffiti and tearing at barricades. Also on Friday, police said seven more men had been arrested for unlawful assembly in the Yuen Long attack on July 21, when a group of men in white T-shirts attacked passengers at the town’s MTR station. Police said some of those arrested had triad backgrounds. One was stopped trying to cross the border at the Lok Ma Chau check point. Meanwhile, the latest poll by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found that 79 per cent of the 1,000 people questioned wanted the bill to be withdrawn, while only half wanted Carrie Lam to resign. The poll showed that younger respondents were more opposed to the bill than the older generation. Overall, some 69 per cent of participants were opposed to the bill – but the figure rose to over 90 per cent for respondents aged between 14 and 29.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021276/hong-kong-civil-servants-embarrass-government-protest
"After vandals trash Canadian university’s Hong Kong-protest Lennon Wall, student society blasts ‘bullying’ and vows to set up mobile replacement","A new wall of messages will be mounted on wheels and locked away at night at Vancouver’s Simon Fraser University to thwart repeated vandalism; Video shows a young man methodically ripping apart previous messages about the Hong Kong protests, ignoring pleas to stop","12:27am, 3 Aug, 2019","The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong have resulted in a spike in interest in Malaysian property and private international school enquiries.; Street demonstrations have rocked Hong Kong of late. The now-abandoned extradition bill, which revolved around extraditing alleged criminals to China for trial, caused unhappiness that has evolved into pro-democracy violence on the streets, in the airport and on the public train transport system.; It was also reported recently that people from Hong Kong are increasingly seeking out properties in Singapore.; This story originally appeared on The Star Online","The student society at a Canadian university has voted to stand up to “bullying” and “harassment” in which a “Lennon Wall” of messages supporting Hong Kong protesters was repeatedly trashed, announcing it will install a mobile version of the wall on wheels to thwart the vandals. A video posted on YouTube on Wednesday shows a Mandarin-speaking young man methodically ripping apart the wall at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia as someone pleads for him to stop. “I don’t understand,” says the unseen person making the video. “What did we do wrong? We are just expressing our opinions.” The vandal responds: “I didn’t say anything. Call security if you like. I’m not scared.” The response to the wall’s destruction was made late on Thursday after an hours-long meeting of the board of the Simon Fraser University Student Society, the elected body that represents the 25,000-plus undergraduates at the Vancouver-area institution. The society “stands firmly in support of the right of all Simon Fraser University students to peacefully, respectfully and freely express their views regarding the ongoing political situation in Hong Kong”, says the resolution. The new Lennon Wall will be installed with “the shortest delays possible” outside the society’s headquarters at SFU’s Burnaby campus. It will be mounted on wheels and rolled behind locked doors every night to protect it from whoever tore down the messages in support of the protests on at least four nights this past week. The destroyed notes had been posted on a message board outside SFU’s main WAC Bennett Library since July 22. “[The] Simon Fraser Student Society condemns any attempt to censor or dissuade through threats, harassment or bullying such expression,” the society’s resolution adds. The three-minute video showing the wall’s destruction depicts a burly young man in a dark shirt selectively pulling down the colourful messages on the library wall, helped by a second man in a yellow hoodie. The person apparently shooting the video says: “If you are going to tear them down, why not tear everything down … we hope you look at the news and understand what’s happening … “You’ve come out [to Canada], there’s press freedom, you can see what’s happening in the world.” The large man ignores pleas for him to stop and continues stuffing the messages in a garbage bag, as the man in yellow responds: “We know what’s been happening.” The voices in the video have been digitally altered. A member of the university’s Hong Kong Society told the South China Morning Post that the student who filmed it fears being put in danger by identification. Student Kayli Jamieson, 20, who is half Chinese and has relatives in Hong Kong, proposed the mobile Lennon Wall to the student society in response to the destruction. She said she was “shocked, angry and saddened” about the repeated vandalism of the original wall. Lennon Walls – usually made up of messages on colourful Post-it notes, and named after a wall that sprang up in Prague in tribute to the late Beatle John Lennon in 1980 – have been a key feature of the ongoing Hong Kong protests, in opposition to the government’s now-suspended extradition bill. They have been adopted by supporters of the protests around the world. But the original SFU wall was repeatedly vandalised. Messages were torn down, defaced or pasted over with rival messages condemning the Hong Kong protesters as “rioters” and “thugs”. On Thursday morning, just a handful of rumpled messages about the Hong Kong protests remained on the library message board. Even notes that warned students not to vandalise others’ posters were ripped and rumpled. “Condemn terrorism in Yuen Long,” said one of the few remaining messages, referring to an attack on Hong Kong protesters on July 22. “Police = triad,” said another. A few curious students inspected the tattered remnants, now hard to spot among fliers advertising guitar lessons, tutors and campus activities. Mainland Chinese student Lance, 22, who declined to give his surname, was unimpressed. He said the messages criticising Hong Kong police were “disgusting”. A third-year business administration student from Guangzhou, Lance said of the Hong Kong protesters: “They are just teenagers … those attacking the police, someone is behind them.” Asked who, he had no hesitation: “It’s the United States.” Regarding fellow SFU students who supported the Hong Kong protesters, he said: “They are only getting a part of the story … they have that stereotype that everything about the Chinese Communist Party is bad. It’s a wrong stereotype.” Sylvia Ceacero, executive director of the SFU Student Society, said in an interview before the board meeting that campus security would be consulted about the new rolling Lennon Wall. “Whatever we implement must be safe for everybody,” said Ceacero. “This is on the heels of the difficulties we are seeing around the world,” a reference to physical clashes between mainland Chinese and Hong Kong students at the University of Queensland in Australia and New Zealand’s Auckland University. She added: “The goal is to respect peaceful political expression.” Jamieson, a communications student, said those who tore down messages on the library Lennon Wall “don’t have a proper understanding of the situation; maybe they are misinformed about what Hongkongers are fighting for”. “Democracy is an important right. Freedom of expression is an important right,” she said. Jamieson said she was particularly upset by Chinese-language messages circulated last weekend on an SFU student WeChat group with almost 500 members, boasting of the destruction and calling for more volunteers to rip down the “trash” posters. “It made me really angry, so I started thinking about what we could do about it,” she said, describing how the idea for a wheeled wall came about. An executive member of the SFU Hong Kong Society (HKS), who did not want to be named, said the group did not set up the library Lennon Wall, but was disappointed to see it repeatedly trashed. She said it had been torn down at least four times. “We are upset more than angry,” said the 19 year-old Hongkonger, who is studying health sciences. “Everyone should respect freedom of speech.” The HKS had told students via social media not to put up inappropriate messages, and had circulated details about how to respond to violence. The society also posted a Facebook message about the wall that ended with the invocation, “Stand with Hong Kong”. Like Ceacero, the HKS executive said the group was mindful of physical clashes at universities overseas. “Our role is to prevent anything violent happening here,” she said. “I’m worried. I just hope that something like that doesn’t happen in Canada.” Another message shared by the HKS on its Facebook page quoted two former presidents of the group, who condemned the defacement of the library Lennon Wall: “We highly commend SFU’s Hong Kong students for their peaceful struggle … [they] will never bow down to atrocities.” Lance, the mainland Chinese student, found some common ground with the HKS and the SFU Student Society. He agreed that everyone should be free to express their views at SFU. “They can bring their opinion,” he said. “But that doesn’t change people’s minds … [mainland Chinese] students will just think ‘It is disgusting’. But we respect that other people have that opinion.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3021275/canada-university-blasts-bullying-and-will-set-mobile-lennon

A further eight people were arrested in Sha Tin, after police raided an industrial estate and found another cache of weapons, including baseball bats, sharpened sticks, and bows and arrows. “Some substance has been added to the bombs to make them more lethal,” said Li Kwai-wah, senior superintendent of Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. “The force is worried about the violent protests in recent days, which saw smoke bombs and iron marbles being used, an escalation from previous protests where water bottles and bricks were being thrown at officers.” Li also attacked the “hateful” comments directed at the force online, adding, “there is a correlation between the increasing violence and the online speech inciting that violence”. He also confirmed the seizure of an imitation firearm during the July 27 protest in Yuen Long. “If someone takes out or uses the imitation firearm at a very chaotic and complicated protest, it can lead to very grave consequences as nobody would know if that is real or fake,” Li said. In a raid on a flat in Haribest Industrial Building on Au Pui Wan street in Sha Tin on Thursday night, police arrested seven men and one woman, including Andy Chan Ho-tin, the founder of the outlawed Hong Kong National Party. The group were arrested on suspicion of possession of offensive weapons, possession of instruments fit for unlawful purpose, and possession of explosives without a licence – which could attract a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail. Officers escorted Chan, who had his hands chained to his waist, to his home in Shui Chuen O Estate in Sha Tin for a search on Friday afternoon. Seized items from the industrial building included a petrol bomb, 10 baseball bats, 20 sharpened walking sticks, 15 sets of walkie-talkie, two bows, six arrows, metal balls and several cartons of protective gear – such as helmets, gas masks and arm guards. Some bottles believed to be used to make petrol bombs were also seized, along with oil containing suspected cannabis content, black and white T-shirts, and a cane. Li said they would investigate if the weapons, which were similar to items found during the recent protests, were related to the demonstrations. The arrests and seizures were made after officers spotted four of the suspects pushing a trolley loaded with a carton box and several red, white and blue nylon bags. Officers raided a flat in the industrial building after finding a key from one of the suspects. The arrest of the eight people prompted hundreds of their supporters to gather outside Sha Tin and Ma On Shan police stations, where Li condemned them for damaging security cameras and communication devices and spray-painting the walls of the premises. Meanwhile, police arrested seven more men, aged between 18 and 55, for unlawful assembly in relation to the mob attack at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21. Police said some have triad backgrounds, bringing the total number of arrests so far to 19. The first 12 men, nine with suspected triad background, have been bailed out. Chan Tin-chu, senior superintendent of the New Territories North regional headquarters, said more offences could be involved if further information was found during the investigation. But he did not explain why police could take action more swiftly against extradition bill protesters than against Yuen Long attackers. Separately, three Hong Kong residents have been arrested on suspicion of inciting people to commit crimes and trying to get a loan using personal data of a police officer leaked online. The three men, aged between 26 and 39, including an interior designer and a decoration worker, were picked up in a series of raids across the city since Tuesday. They had been released on bail and none of them were charged. One of them was arrested for inciting others to attack police with weapons and the other was accused of calling on people on the Internet to besiege an officer’s flat. The third man was arrested on suspicion of fraud, after he allegedly tried to use a policeman’s personal data to apply for a loan.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021271/police-warn-more-violence-hong-kong-protests-after
"Anti-extradition strikes planned across Hong Kong on Monday to be ‘peaceful, rational and non-violent’, organisers say","Activists promise Monday’s demonstrations will be ‘completely peaceful’ and prove that not all protests end with violence; Rallies to be held in Admiralty, Mong Kok, Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Tsuen Wan and Tuen Mun – and outside Disneyland","11:18pm, 2 Aug, 2019","The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong have resulted in a spike in interest in Malaysian property and private international school enquiries.; Street demonstrations have rocked Hong Kong of late. The now-abandoned extradition bill, which revolved around extraditing alleged criminals to China for trial, caused unhappiness that has evolved into pro-democracy violence on the streets, in the airport and on the public train transport system.; It was also reported recently that people from Hong Kong are increasingly seeking out properties in Singapore.; This story originally appeared on The Star Online","Activists from all walks of life are set for strikes and rallies in eight districts on Monday, in what they intend to be a “completely peaceful” episode in the anti-extradition movement. Au Nok-hin, a Council Front lawmaker and one of the strike organisers, said on Friday it should be proven that not all protests need to end in confrontations with police. Activists also revised the locations for the citywide rallies set for Monday. Along with demonstrations in Admiralty, Mong Kok, Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Tsuen Wan and Tuen Mun – the latest plan includes a rally outside Disneyland in Sunny Bay for the theme park’s employees. Organisers have so far applied for letters of no objection from the police for five out of the eight locations. Carol Ng Man-yee, chairwoman of the Confederation of Trade Unions, said labour unions from five airlines, two in the bus industry and one for MTRC employees had called on its members to strike on Monday. Activists said the plan was for workers to join the anti-extradition rally nearest to their homes. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Au acknowledged that many protesters had been arrested after clashes with the police. “Not all anti-extradition protests end the same way,” Au said. “We have to be extremely peaceful, rational and non-violent.” Au said demonstrators would reiterate the five demands of the anti-extradition movement, including a full withdrawal of the government’s extradition bill and an independent investigation into the police’s use of force. The now-shelved extradition bill would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions where Hong Kong has no formal handover agreement, including mainland China. Wong Yik-mo, vice-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, urged protesters and police to stay calm and avoid conflict on Monday. Wong, who is coordinating the Tai Po rally at Fung Shui Square, apologised in advance to the public for any potential inconveniences. “We sincerely apologise to you. We might get into your way, but what we want to do is voice our demands in a peaceful manner,” Wong said. Ng said unions from five airlines – Cathay Pacific, Cathay Dragon, Hong Kong Airlines, British Airways and Finnair – had encouraged members to join the Monday strike. She said she was not sure if flights would be affected, but that companies would make manpower arrangements before Monday. Apart from the transport unions, Ng said labour associations from Chinese University and City University also made appeals for work stoppages on Monday. Ng said it was hard to gauge how many workers would actually go on strike, warning that labour protection does not apply to strikes of a political nature. “This time it is a political strike, so the level of protection is very low and close to non-existent,” Ng said. Separately, Cardinal John Tong wrote to Catholic church officials on Friday, asking them to be lenient about employees’ requests to take Monday off to join the mass strike. “While maintaining vital services and operations, [the requests] can be handled in a relaxed manner, so our colleagues can express their concern for society,” Tong said. A spokesman from the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Market said all operations would be normal on Monday. “As the market operator in Hong Kong, keeping our markets operating and functioning is always our top priority,” he said. A Citibank spokesman said the company had a “business continuity plan in place” to minimise the impact to customers and businesses. A Standard Chartered Bank spokesman said the bank understood the current social situation and respected their staff’s right to freedom of expression. “We believe in the professionalism of our staff and trust that they can strike a balance between their own rights, the operation of the bank and the needs of our customers,” he said. Employees at four top accountancy firms – KPMG, Deloitte, EY, and PwC – received unofficial messages urging people to take part in the strike. The firms had not yet replied to requests for comment from the Post. Kowloon Motor Bus said it would monitor the Monday strike and make necessary arrangement in bus services. The city’s railway operator, MTR Corporation, has not replied to the Post about its plans for Monday.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021268/anti-extradition-strikes-planned-across-hong-kong-monday-be

Pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho calls on Hong Kong police to arrest five opposition legislators and several ‘unknown foreigners’ for inciting protesters,Ho shows pictures of men he accuses of setting fires and making tactical signals during recent clashes; Lawmaker has become hate figure since he was filmed shaking hands with men accused of carrying out Yuen Long station attack,"4:31pm, 2 Aug, 2019",He also slammed Ho for diverting attention from his links with the men who attacked protesters and some passers-by at Yuen Long railway station on July 21. Ho was filmed shaking hands with men in white T-shirts accused of being involved in the violence.,"A controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong has called on police to arrest five opposition legislators and a number of “foreigners” seen at recent clashes during anti-government protests. Junius Ho Kwan-yiu – who has recently become a hate figure for pro-democracy residents – claimed the people played a “very important role” in the violent exchanges. Ho’s claims were quickly dismissed by the pan-democrats as unsubstantiated. The lawmakers he named on Friday were Democratic Party members Lam Cheuk-ting, Roy Kwong Chun-yu and Andrew Wan Siu-kin, independent Eddie Chu Hoi-dick and Civic Passion’s Cheng Chung-tai, who were said to be repeatedly spotted on the ground. “I urge the police force to take decisive action in arresting and prosecuting them,” Ho said, accusing the lawmakers of committing crimes such as incitement to public nuisance, unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers in their duties. During a press conference at which he refused to take questions, Ho showed pictures of what he called “unknown foreigners” whom he accused of starting a fire at clashes in Sheung Wan last Sunday, as well as filming and “commanding” the crowd with hand signals at a Sha Tin protest on July 14. The man in Sha Tin was earlier identified as a foreign worker who regularly posts on Twitter, under the name Hong Kong Hermit. He clarified he was merely scratching his belly at the time. In a written reply, Hong Kong Hermit, who has lived in the city for more than a decade, said he was only a Hongkonger exercising his rights. It was insulting for Ho to imply the protesters needed the “guidance of superior white people to get anything done”, he added. He said his employer was worried about his safety after the pro-Beijing lawmaker had placed a target on his back, adding he would seek legal advice. Democratic Party lawmaker Lam said he was only at the scene to mediate and defuse tensions between protesters and police officers. “All this could be clearly seen from the clips as well as the live videos. Ho should show the evidence to substantiate his claims, if there is any,” he said, adding the young protesters on the front line had made their own calls. “It appears Ho found a belly-scratching foreigner has committed a more serious crime than gangsters who attacked civilians with rods,” he said. Wan also hit out at Ho’s “hilarious, misleading and ironic” accusations, which he said would do no good to society. “We are trying to be a buffer at the protests. We have called on the officers not to exercise excessive force and asked for more time for the protesters to leave,” Wan said. “Our presence has in fact reduced the scale and the area of the clashes.” Wan added they would consider legal action against the “libellous” remarks made by pro-establishment politicians over the previous two months. Lam said Ho should not regard all non-Chinese Hong Kong residents as foreign agents. Meanwhile, Ho distanced himself from recent death threats Chu said he received from triads. Chu claimed the threats surfaced after Ho accused him and his supporters of being involved in the desecration of Ho’s parents’ graves on July 23, and told him he had two options – choose the path of the living or dead. Ho said he was also worried about his own personal safety. Separately, about 20,000 people signed a petition started by the Labour Party urging the government to revoke Ho’s title as a Justice of the Peace. Party chairman Steven Kwok Wing-kin argued Ho, given his links with the alleged Yuen Long attackers, was unfit to hold the position.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021179/pro-beijing-lawmaker-junius-ho-calls-hong-kong-police
First suspect in court over Hong Kong extradition bill protests sees number of charges against him triple,"Defendant now charged with seven counts of assaulting a police officer, one of unauthorised assembly and another for criminal damage; All of those offences allegedly committed outside city’s police headquarters on June 21","2:09pm, 2 Aug, 2019",He also slammed Ho for diverting attention from his links with the men who attacked protesters and some passers-by at Yuen Long railway station on July 21. Ho was filmed shaking hands with men in white T-shirts accused of being involved in the violence.,"The first suspect to appear in court in connection with the wave of protests against the now-abandoned extradition bill saw the list of charges he faced triple on Friday. Pun Ho-chiu, 31, known as “Occupy Mong Kok Painter” for his participation in the 2014 movement for greater democracy, was charged with nine offences after prosecutors restructured the case. Among them was a new charge of taking part in an unauthorised assembly on June 21, when crowds surrounded police headquarters in protest at what they claimed was the use of excessive force during violent clashes outside the city’s legislature on June 12. His original charge of assaulting eight police officers was broken down into separate counts, each of them limited to one officer, with prosecutors withdrawing the allegations over a senior constable. In a separate case, Eastern Court also heard Pun pleaded not guilty to an allegation he damaged a desk belonging to the judiciary, during security checks at the High Court in Admiralty on January 16. Acting chief magistrate Peter Law Tak-chuen has adjourned both proceedings, pushing the protest case back by six weeks upon a defence request and setting the other one for a trial to begin on September 27. Five witnesses were expected to testify against him at trial, in which he would be defended by counsel Fiona Nam. Pun appeared nervous in the dock, his shoulders hunched and his head low, as five police officers stood guard closely behind him. Dozens have turned up to show support in the public gallery. In the amended case involving nine offences brought to court by public prosecutor Karen Ng Ka-yuet, Pun was charged with seven counts of assaulting police and one each of taking part in an unauthorised assembly and criminal damage. All of the offences were said to have taken place outside Wan Chai Police Station on Arsenal Street on June 21. The officers named in the assault charges were detective constables Chan Tsz-hin and Lo Cheuk-kei, detective sergeants Fong Chi-yeung and Lo Wai-tung, sergeants Leung Cheuk-hei and Man Chun-wan, and Inspector Diana Thumb. Pun was accused of pelting eggs towards these officers and their shields, and damaging the walls and escalators of the station without lawful excuse. Prosecutors have also withdrawn an earlier charge of behaving in a disorderly manner in a public place, which accused Pun of shouting foul language, abusive, insulting words, making offensive gestures at officers, and appealing for other protesters to provide him with more eggs to throw at police. But the Post understands the allegations stemming from the charge will be woven into the remaining counts. Pun’s lawyer Ng Gene-bond asked for time to gather documents and consult legal advice, but did not apply for his bail. The case will return to the same court on September 11.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021138/first-suspect-court-over-hong-kong-extradition-bill
Hong Kong No 2 official Matthew Cheung warns staff against behaviour that clashes with government views ahead of rally organised by civil servants,City’s deputy leader tells rank-and-file officials not to ‘do things’ at odds with government position; A group of young civil servants organise rally on Friday in opposition to administration’s now-abandoned extradition bill,"11:38am, 2 Aug, 2019","Hong Kong’s deputy leader has warned workers on the public payroll not to “do things in contrast with the government’s views”, ahead of Friday’s unprecedented rally organised by young civil servants over the extradition bill crisis.; Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, who was revealed to have been undergoing treatment for a cyst in his nose at Queen Mary Hospital, also said his condition did not affect his work.; The rally against the now-shelved extradition bill organised by young civil servants was set to be held at 7pm on Friday at Chater Garden, Central.","Speaking outside the hospital in Pok Fu Lam on Friday, Cheung reiterated the government’s stance that civil servants should be politically neutral. “As civil servants we must maintain neutrality,” Cheung said. “Our aim is to serve the public. Let’s not let personal views on politics affect our work.” Organisers expected 2,000 people to turn up to echo the five main demands of the wider movement against the bill, which includes a full withdrawal of the draft legislation and the establishment of an independent probe into police’s use of force. The bill would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal, including mainland China. At least two civil servant unions – the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association and the Radio Television Hong Kong Programme Staff Union – said they would attend. Cheung said civil servants were free to engage in activities outside work, but added: “You cannot in the name of civil servants, do things in contrast with the government’s views. “This will give a wrong impression there is a split in views within the government, or confrontations.” Speaking on a radio programme on Friday, the former secretary for civil service Joseph Wong Wing-ping said the government should reflect on what it could do to mend ties with the public. “If the government’s relationship with the people is harmonious and it is responsive to public opinion, then civil servants can better support the government,” Wong said. The Hong Kong government also called for civil servants’ “total loyalty” to the “chief executive and the government of the day” in a statement on Thursday. “In accordance with the established mechanism, [we will] seriously follow up on any violations of regulations by civil servants,” the statement read. In an anonymous response, a group of “off-duty civil servants” from 52 government departments wrote that civil servants’ right to public assembly was protected by Article 27 of the Basic Law, which is often dubbed the city’s mini-constitution. “We demand the government to respect and strictly follow the Basic Law and stop making statements that may cause panic among civil servants,” the letter read. The Post has approached the rally’s organisers for comment. Other public sector staff have shared their opinion. A worker from the Education Bureau said he believed civil servants were free to express their views when off-duty. “I believe most of the civil servants are well aware of their identity and will attend the rally as a Hongkonger, rather than as a civil servant,” he said. Another civil servant said she would be joining the rally despite the stern warnings. “Our job is to give suitable comments and recommendations to government initiatives,” she said. “Given the situation is getting out of control, we are just using a peaceful way to voice our opinions to the public.” Meanwhile, Cheung said a “tiny cyst” was found in his nose during an annual body check. “The doctor said it is not a big problem, but for safety’s sake ... it is best to treat it,” Cheung said, adding it did not put him off doing his job. “It does not affect my work, I went to work as usual, thank you for your concern.” Cheung also said the hospital had arranged his appointments outside regular hours so as not to affect other patients.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021094/hong-kong-no-2-official-matthew-cheung-warns-staff-against
Hong Kong voter registration skyrockets to biggest gain since at least 2003 – with huge increase driven by ‘dissatisfaction’ over extradition bill crisis,"More than 386,000 new registered voters is biggest annual gain since at least 2003; Surge is driven by more than 12 per cent rise in registrations from those aged 18 to 35","8:00am, 2 Aug, 2019",The number of registered voters between the ages of 18 and 35 has jumped more than 12 per cent from last year – the surge resulting from hundreds of thousands of young Hongkongers signing up to vote amid the extradition bill crisis.,"Nearly 386,000 people have registered to vote in the past year – the most since at least 2003 – bringing the number of voters in the city to 4.12 million, according to figures released on Thursday by the Registration and Electoral Office. The publication of the 2019 provisional voter registry comes three months before district council elections, the first citywide polls to be held since the extradition bill movement that has rocked the city since June. “Most of these newly registered voters – despite not being all young – are dissatisfied by the government’s handling of the bill,” said Dr Cheung Chor-yung, a political scientist at City University. “They could make a fairly huge impact in the upcoming elections if they are determined to vote out the conservative candidates.” Hongkongers aged between 18 and 35 emerged as the most receptive group to the protesters’ campaign to sign up voters to oust pro-government politicians in coming elections. The 18 to 35 group swelled by 12.3 per cent from 2018, the biggest increase of all age groups and exceeding the overall rise of 8 per cent. Voters aged 71 and above were the second biggest registration group, jumping by 8.7 per cent from last year. The age group between 56 and 70 increased 7.1 per cent, and new voters between 36 and 55 increased 5.5 per cent. In 12 smaller age brackets, the 31 to 35 group and the 26 to 35 group increased by nearly 15 per cent from last year. The group aged between 51 and 55 showed the only decrease, dropping 1.4 per cent. Cheung said young people, compared to the older voters, were generally less eager to cast ballots in local polls, as reflected in turnout rates. “The spike in young voters is definitely driven by the anti-bill protests,” he said. “They realise that if they are to exercise their political power, they have to vote – as well as participating in marches and frontline struggles.” The latest voter registration numbers snapped a downturn in 2018, when there was a decline in the number of registered voters younger than 61. Last year, registered voters in Hong Kong increased by 9,249 from 2017, reaching more than 3.81 million. Analysts at the time attributed the drop to young people’s waning interest in politics after the 2014 Occupy movement – which had failed to make Beijing budge on greater democracy – and the city’s rapidly ageing population. The provisional registers of voters were made open for public inspection with the final electoral rolls set for publication on or before September 25.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021034/hong-kong-voter-registration-skyrockets-biggest-gain-least
How Hongkongers end up in the dock: everything you need to know about how the justice department decides who gets charged,"Recent arrests of more than 180 protesters – and people accused of attacking them – have placed focus on how suspects end up in court; So who has the final say on prosecutions, and can they be politically influenced?","7:00am, 2 Aug, 2019","It is empowered by Article 63 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which states the department shall “control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference”. The idea of independence and the requirement to make prosecution decisions based on evidence and the public interest are also written into the Prosecution Code.","Since a series of extradition bill protests kicked off in June, police have arrested more than 180 protesters across Hong Kong. They have also arrested 12 people allegedly involved in violent attacks against protesters and other passengers at Yuen Long railway station on July 21. Forty-four protesters arrested on Sunday in Sheung Wan – near Beijing’s liaison office in the city – became the first batch of demonstrators charged with rioting. All but one appeared in court on Wednesday. While police and the justice department have moved expeditiously with the Sheung Wan protesters, no charge had been laid by Thursday night over the Yuen Long attacks. The two cases’ speed disparity has prompted people to ask: what is the relationship between law enforcers and prosecutors, especially at a politically sensitive time? Who makes the final call on whether to prosecute someone? The Department of Justice (DOJ) decides on all prosecution decisions in Hong Kong, after reviewing cases from various law enforcement bodies and government departments. The secretary for justice makes the final call on a prosecution. Under the code, the secretary “is responsible for applying the criminal law, formulating prosecution policy, and superintending the director of public prosecutions and prosecutors in the Prosecutions Division”. Does the chief executive have any role? The Hong Kong leader does not and should not have any involvement in prosecution decisions. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has repeatedly said she respects the independence of the justice department’s prosecutorial arm. But critics say the justice minister’s role is problematic, as he or she, being a cabinet member, could create a perception of possible interference by the administration. Prominent lawyers and the pro-democracy camp have called for the justice minister to delegate prosecutorial power to the director of public prosecutions. But current justice chief Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah has rejected that suggestion. What factors must prosecutors consider when bringing a charge? The code lays down a number of factors that prosecutors must consider before exercising their duty, including independence, fairness and the public interest. Before pressing charges, prosecutors should make sure there is a “reasonable prospect of conviction” by considering the evidence. The code also states prosecutors must consider a non-exhaustive list of public-interest factors, including the seriousness of the case, any potential delay, and the age and nature of the suspect, witnesses and victims. What kind of cases go through the DOJ, and how does it work with other law-enforcement departments? The justice department provides legal advice to all law enforcement and government departments, such as the police force, the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Customs and Excise Department. But for minor offences for which fixed penalties are set, such as illegal parking and littering, the responsible departments can make prosecutorial decisions without first consulting the DOJ. How does that work when police arrest someone? After arresting someone, police have to consult the DOJ. In public order cases, such as rioting and unlawful assembly, the DOJ will generally issue written advice and vet the evidence provided by police. If the prosecutors involved conclude there is “reasonable prospect of conviction”, they can proceed to prosecution. At that juncture, prosecutors have the option of going ahead with a “holding charge”, a charge brought temporarily to give police time to investigate. The prosecution can later decide to amend or drop the charge, or bring more charges. How does the justice minister work with the top prosecutor? Within the justice department, David Leung Cheuk-yin, the director of public prosecutions, heads the prosecution division. He is answerable to the secretary for justice, and advises the minister – and the government as a whole – on criminal matters. Cheng and her predecessor Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, both barristers from civil law backgrounds, have reportedly been involved in various controversial prosecution decisions. In Cheng’s case that involves charges against the 44 alleged rioters, while in Yeung’s it involves the review of sentences against three young activists including Joshua Wong Chi-fung over 2014’s pro-democracy Occupy protests. While Cheng has said she has the constitutional duty and power to take up such cases, critics have queried her criminal law expertise.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3021043/how-hongkongers-end-dock-everything-you-need-know
"Silence broken, Beijing looks for ways to take message direct to the Hong Kong public","The central government is exploring options to make its position better known to the city’s people, sources say; Monday’s press conference expected to mark the start of more to come","6:00am, 2 Aug, 2019","It is empowered by Article 63 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which states the department shall “control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference”. The idea of independence and the requirement to make prosecution decisions based on evidence and the public interest are also written into the Prosecution Code.","Beijing’s top office on Hong Kong will be more proactive in engaging the city’s populace after an attack by some radical protesters on the central government’s liaison office in Sai Ying Pun prompted it to hold its first press conference in more than two decades. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China’s cabinet, has deliberately maintained a low profile since the city returned to China from Britain in 1997. Until last week, it had not directly engaged the Hong Kong public, preferring to work with the city’s government instead. The HKMAO broke that silence in the Chinese capital on Monday with its first press conference on Hong Kong affairs, a remarkable move prompted by an unprecedented attack on the liaison office in the city on July 21, according to three people familiar with the arrangements. Now the HKMAO is considering more direct interaction with the Hong Kong media and public, including press conferences and other ways to engage the city’s populace, to better articulate Beijing’s policy, a source familiar with the discussions said. Beijing was shocked by the attack of some radical protesters on its liaison office late last month. The protests – triggered by the city government’s now-abandoned extradition law which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to other jurisdictions, including mainland China – have turned increasingly violent since they began two months ago. On July 21, a group of protesters refused to disperse after a march and gathered outside the liaison office, throwing eggs and ink balloons at the building, defacing the national emblem and spray-painting anti-China slogans on the walls. Images of the sullied national emblem sparked a public uproar in mainland China and soured sentiment towards Hong Kong. A week later, the HKMAO held its first press conference in Beijing to brief the world’s media on its position and views on the city. Sources said the HKMAO started to prepare for the event immediately after the attack. Without elaborating, two of the sources said the wording and tone of the statement was dictated by the “higher authority”. The HKMAO is a ministerial level office. During the Monday press conference in Beijing, HKMAO spokesman Yang Guang took a moderate line, careful to differentiate between the “peaceful demonstrations” and “some radical elements”. He also offered unqualified praise for the city’s embattled police, which has been accused of excessive use of force. Yang also underlined the central government’s support for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who is widely considered responsible for the city’s biggest political crisis since the handover. Yang singled out the attack on the liaison office as a challenge to the authority of the central government and said it touched the bottom line of “one country, two systems”, the principle by which Hong Kong maintains its own political, legal, economic and financial systems. The press conference drew a mixed reaction in Hong Kong, with the police force welcoming the support and opposition lawmakers criticising Beijing for losing touch with the public.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3021036/silence-broken-beijing-looks-ways-take-message-direct-hong-kong

Ahead of a campaign event in Ohio on Thursday, Trump was asked whether he was concerned by media reports that Beijing might intervene in Hong Kong. He said the city had experienced “riots for a long period of time”. “And I don’t know what China’s attitude is. Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that. But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China,” he said. “Hong Kong is a part of China, they’ll have to deal with that themselves.” Trump’s labelling of the demonstrations as riots is certain to rile activists in the Asian financial centre who have called on the city’s government to drop the use of the word to describe the protests, and some diplomatic observers. Jorge Guajardo, former Mexican ambassador to China, said Trump’s comment “invites a crackdown, precisely at a time when he should have been unequivocal warning against it”. But Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Trump had rightly pointed out that Hong Kong was part of China, and that the violence seen in the city was rioting. “The Chinese government stance is clear. Hong Kong affairs are the internal affairs of China, and the Chinese government will not let foreign forces intervene in it, and will not let foreign forces create chaos in Hong Kong,” Hua said on Friday. She also took aim at US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for meeting Hong Kong opposition figures, and US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting the protests. Trump’s remarks came after China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi on Thursday accused the US and other Western countries of “fanning the fires” of unrest in Hong Kong by supporting “violent radicals” who sought to destabilise the city. “Some Western governments, including the US, have reversed black and white and confused right and wrong in the amendment bill storm, continuously fanning the fires in Hong Kong and making inappropriate comments,” said Yang, who is a member of the Communist Party’s top decision-making body, the Politburo, and head of the Central Leading Group on Foreign Affairs. “They have even arranged for high-level officials to meet with Hong Kong leaders of this chaos, bolstering the illegal activities of these Hong Kong violent radicals, working to undermine Hong Kong’s prosperity, stability and security,” he said. Yang is a deputy head of the party’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs central coordination group, which is chaired by Han Zheng. The Xinhua interview did not identify the Western government leaders Yang was referring to, but Pence and US national security adviser John Bolton met Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying and other political leaders in Washington in June and expressed concern over the extradition bill. The proposed legislation, which has now been shelved, would allow criminal suspects to be sent to jurisdictions including mainland China, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial. The protests which have rocked Hong Kong since mid-June have not only plunged the city into its biggest political crisis since its 1997 handover from Britain to China, but have also put it in the international spotlight as foreign governments and leaders air their worries about its stability and future. Foreign Minister Wang Yi also raised the issue of the extradition bill unrest on Thursday when he met Pompeo on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Bangkok. Wang told Pompeo that the US must “respect China’s core interests and main concerns”, the Xinhua report said. On Wednesday, former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, who is now a vice-chairman of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, blamed the US and Taiwan for serving as the “masterminds” of the city’s unrest. Yang on Thursday, meanwhile, said China expressed “strong indignation and resolute opposition” to Western governments interfering in Hong Kong matters, according to Xinhua. “These are gross acts of interference in China’s internal affairs, and as a flagrant violation of basic norms of international law and international relations, have also seriously damaged the healthy development of China’s relations with these countries,” he was quoted as saying. Yang denounced the “radical protesters” in Hong Kong, who he said had threatened the city’s public safety while affecting its rule of law, social order, economic livelihood and international image. He repeated that Hong Kong’s experience had proven the “one country, two systems” model was a success, adding that Beijing firmly supported the city government and the need to handle the unrest according to the law. The protesters have five key demands, including the official withdrawal of the bill, police accountability in the use of force to quell demonstrations and universal suffrage for city elections.

UK’s new foreign secretary calls on China to respect ‘peaceful protest’ in Hong Kong,"Dominic Raab issues statement after first meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at Asean session in Thailand; ‘The UK and China have a joint and legal commitment to the freedoms enshrined in the Joint Declaration,’ Raab said he reminded Wang","1:49am, 2 Aug, 2019","Yang, the highest-ranking Chinese official to publicly weigh in on the escalating protests triggered by a controversial extradition bill, demanded through the official Xinhua news agency that the US “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.","The new administration of Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made its first comment concerning Hong Kong, calling on China to respect peaceful protests in the former British colony. Dominic Raab, Britain’s new foreign secretary and de facto deputy prime minister, made the remarks after his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in Bangkok, Thailand. “We are clear and candid when we disagree,” Raab said in a statement following his discussion with Wang on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). “On Hong Kong, I underlined that the UK and China have a joint and legal commitment to the freedoms enshrined in the Joint Declaration, and that while we deplore any violence, peaceful protest is a basic right and should be respected,” Raab said. According to Chinese state media Xinhua, Wang called on Britain to “appropriately handle relevant sensitive questions” with China. Apart from Hong Kong, the development of 5G technology and post-Brexit trading agreements with China were also discussed between the two sides, according to a diplomatic source. “The UK and China have an important and constructive partnership, which we want to build on,” Raab said in the statement. “We have a strong economic relationship. We work together as permanent members of the UN Security Council, and today discussed shared areas of concern such as the Iran nuclear deal and North Korea’s recent missile launches,” he added. In their meeting, Raab and Wang did not mention the “golden era” relationship between their two countries, reached between President Xi Jinping and then British prime minister David Cameron in 2015. China has talked less about the golden era since the Brexit referendum in 2016, when the UK became less influential on the European stage. While running for the posts of Tory party leader and prime minister, Johnson told a Chinese television station that Britain was “enthusiastic” about China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a massive trade and infrastructure plan that seeks to link China to Europe, Asia and Africa via the old Silk Road trading routes. He stopped short, however, of saying whether Britain would follow Italy by signing up for the programme, a signature geopolitical strategy of President Xi.

Hong Kong extradition bill protesters win rare support from mainland China as supportive social media posts go viral,"Gestures of solidarity comes as Chinese state media criticises violent acts by protesters and endorses police; Meanwhile, in Taipei, space for a Lennon Wall has been reserved and sponsored by nine city councillors","12:08am, 2 Aug, 2019","The gestures of solidarity came as Chinese state media continued to criticise violent acts by protesters while endorsing Hong Kong’s police.; The bill would have allowed Hong Kong to transfer suspects to jurisdictions with which it does not have an extradition agreement, including mainland China.; Across the strait in Taiwan, a Lennon Wall would be built between August 2 and 21 in a pedestrian tunnel in Taipei under the junction of Xinsheng South Road and Roosevelt Road after a pro-Beijing group destroyed one under the city’s commercial heartland Ximending last week.; “[Chinese President] Xi Jinping has proposed a Taiwan version of ‘one country two systems’, but we can all see what has happened to Hong Kong under ‘one country two systems’,” said Chiang, an economics graduate from the University of Hong Kong.","Hong Kong’s ongoing protests against a now-shelved extradition bill appeared to have won rare support from mainland China as more than 10 pictures of ID cards and passports decorated with supportive stickers went viral online on Thursday. In Taipei, meanwhile, nine city councillors reserved space in a city centre pedestrian tunnel to build a Lennon Wall for residents to post messages of support for Hong Kong. Colourful collages of Post-it notes have sprang up in more than 70 locations in Hong Kong during the protests. Photos shared on LIHKG – a Reddit-like online platform that has served as a virtual main stage for the extradition bill protests – showed mainland Chinese citizen ID cards and passports along with handwritten messages. “Support ‘no extradition to China’. Support Hong Kong people’s just fight,” one said. “For [Hong Kong], your perseverance is so touching. All your efforts will become sunshine in your future,” another said. A handwritten poem, with the footnote Xian, in simplified Chinese characters – only used in the mainland, unlike Taiwan and Hong Kong which use traditional characters – read “Don’t grieve for our sorrow … We are born in such darkness. Endless darkness envelops our past, present and future.” The Post could not verify the authenticity of the photos. While the bill has been declared “dead” by Hong Kong’s leader, protests against the government and police have been going on for nine weeks. One mainlander who was not part of the action and had been following news about the bill since March said the photos did not mean a sizeable number of mainland Chinese people shared the sympathy because “it is easy to gather a number of ID cards on the mainland”. The person, who gave his name as Buzz, admitted he would hide his sympathy for Hong Kong and echo his friends’ criticism as the city increasingly became an inevitable and controversial topic in conversation. “I will not say things that betray my principles because I know we cannot have normal discussions here [in mainland China],” he said. “In our news, the Hong Kong protesters are labelled as separatists and dumb. Meanwhile, many comments urge Beijing to deploy the military and associate the cause of the movement with Hong Kong’s slow economic growth.” The wall space was reserved and sponsored by nine Taipei city councillors and would be managed by Hong Kong Outlanders, a newly established group of Taiwan students in Hong Kong. One of the group’s founders Chiang Min-yen said Taiwan had been highly concerned about protests in Hong Kong and calls to donate helmets to protesters received a surprisingly active response under the increasingly felt “China threat”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3021054/hong-kong-extradition-bill-protesters-win-rare-support
Banker flash mob in Hong Kong as financial sector workers gather in Chater Garden to protest against government handling of extradition bill crisis,"Hundreds of office workers join protest against government’s handling of extradition bill crisis; On cue, protesters raise phones with flashlight on and chant slogans – then they applaud and disperse","10:40pm, 1 Aug, 2019","There was none of the violence the city has become used to during protests against the bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China among other jurisdictions. But the usually peaceful Chater Garden in Central was a little rowdier as the gathering chanted anti-government slogans, before marching the short distance to the IFC Mall.; Supposedly a leaderless movement, others were there distributing face masks and placards to participants. They all declined to be interviewed.; Hundreds from the financial industry held up umbrellas, a symbol of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, in the ""Freedom snooze, market lose"" event as they gathered in Central, the financial heart of the city where major banks are located. pic.twitter.com/ipgIOKMwil; — ayana (@ayanchiu) August 1, 2019; Even the lingering rain from an outgoing storm that caused the city’s first No 8 typhoon signal of the year to be raised a day earlier could not dampen spirits.; At about 7.30pm, the protesters raised their mobile phones with the flashlight function turned on and chanted slogans that have become battle cries of the protest movement: “Hong Kong people, add oil”; “Revolution of the era, reclaim Hong Kong”; and “No rioter, only tyranny”. Their shouts echoed from the district’s skyscrapers.","A flashily dressed flash mob converged on a park in Hong Kong’s business district on Thursday evening, as hundreds of office workers joined a protest against the government’s handling of the extradition bill crisis. Many said they were responding to an online campaign calling on those working in the financial sector to join the protest after work on Thursday. Likewise, there was no organiser to confirm a headcount, though some participants estimated there were at least 600 people there. One person claiming to be an organiser told the media on Telegram, an encrypted online forum popular among protesters, that 4,300 turned up. Irene Lau, a clerk at a trading company in Tsim Sha Tsui, said she left work early to join the protest. “It’s important for Hong Kong people to take every opportunity to voice their discontent with the government,” she said. “The police have been too violent suppressing the young protesters.” Ivan Ho, a bank teller in Central, said he had also asked to leave early. “My supervisor didn’t ask many questions. We knew what it’s for,” Ho said. “The bad weather doesn’t matter. We have umbrellas,” said an attendee, who declined to give her name. The crowd started building around 7pm, about half an hour before the scheduled start. They stood around, chatting with friends and looking at their phones. Living up to its flash mob label, the protest was brief. The attendees concluded it by thanking each other and applauding. While most of the protesters left after the rally, about 100 marched about 1km to the IFC Mall. No police officers were seen during the protest.

Hong Kong riot charges pushed ahead in unprecedented hardline move as justice chief forgoes usual written advice,"Teresa Cheng opted to give police verbal assent on prosecutions, which could end in 10-year sentences for 44 people; Move seen as seeking to deter further protests, amid allegations from prosecutors that political considerations are involved","4:06pm, 1 Aug, 2019","On the eve of the civil servants’ protest, the government issued a stern warning that those who flouted the rules of political neutrality and loyalty to the administration would face consequences. It was “totally unacceptable” for civil servants to compromise themselves politically, it said, signalling that actions such as penning anonymous open letters or taking part in strikes or assemblies would divide the service and damage public confidence in it.; Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong became the third university chief to issue a statement on the way ahead, calling for a “truth commission”.; After a relatively quiet Wednesday as storms sparking signal No 8 prevailed, protesters emerged again on Thursday, including a flash mob of several hundred finance workers in Central, and demonstrators at Sha Tin’s New Town Plaza mall, the site of earlier violent clashes between protesters and police a fortnight ago. Two separate pro-government groups protested outside the headquarters of Cathay Pacific Airways and its majority shareholder Swire Pacific – at the airport and in Admiralty respectively – because one of the carrier’s pilots was among the 44 alleged rioters.","Hong Kong’s justice secretary gave a verbal agreement rather than conventional written advice to police to charge protesters with rioting this week, the Post has learned, in a move viewed as eagerness to “fast-track” prosecutions and send a deterrent message to demonstrators. Two legal sources also said Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah signed off on using the riot offence as a holding charge, instead of prosecuting the accused on a lesser charge of unlawful assembly, for which they were initially arrested. Revelations of the unprecedented hardline moves came after a group of anonymous prosecutors issued an open letter on Wednesday accusing Cheng of applying political considerations to prosecution decisions. Her spokesman swiftly dismissed the accusations as groundless. But despite the rioting charge being laid against 44 protesters – the first such batch to face the prospect of up to 10 years in jail if found guilty – the city was bracing itself for a ninth consecutive weekend of multiple demonstrations, to be bookended by a Friday rally of an estimated 2,000 civil servants and a planned citywide strike on Monday. The prosecutions of the 44, who were arrested at Sunday’s protests, and the anonymous open letter also sparked debate within the legal fraternity, with some asking why the cases were prioritised over those of the white-shirted perpetrators of the shocking violence in Yuen Long a week earlier. The legal sector also made waves on Thursday when the usually cautious Law Society called for an independent inquiry into the recent political crisis, adding its voice to a growing list of individuals and mainstream institutions appealing for such a move to mend the rifts in society. “Hong Kong citizens cherish freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and this combination has cultivated generations of truth-loving people. We must not shy away from the inconvenient truth about what has happened, which has shocked us to the core over the last several weeks,” he wrote in a letter to the university community. Chinese University chief Professor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi, on the other hand, declined to endorse the idea in a meeting with students. No plea was taken in the riot cases, which were adjourned to September for further investigation. The Sunday protest was among the most recent in nearly two months of anti-government demonstrations sparked by the now-abandoned extradition bill. By Thursday night, only 12 people had been arrested over the Yuen Long attacks, and all were released on bail. None had been charged. Asked about the seemingly different senses of urgency over the cases, a police spokesman said: “The police attach great importance to the related cases and take a cautious approach to handle prosecution work. “The force will continue to deal with law-breaking acts in an impartial manner and take appropriate follow-up action in accordance with evidence.” Eric Cheung Tat-ming, principal law lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said the apparent disparity of attention being paid to the cases could create the “reasonable suspicion of political motive”. “With all the information surfaced but no charges laid, how is that neutral and fair?” he said. Critics said the first large-scale slate of prosecutions for rioting – rather than unlawful assembly – could have a serious deterrent. “It will send a signal that violent protests may have legal consequences,” said Bill Li On-yin of the Progressive Lawyers’ Group. Anyone charged with rioting faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail, while unlawful assembly sentences are capped at five years. During recent protests, many of which ended in violence, police had repeatedly warned protesters they were participating in an unlawful assembly. The force had not mentioned protesters rioting since clashes near the legislature on June 12. In a recent meeting with police, according to the sources, Cheng and top prosecutor David Leung Cheuk-yin supported the force’s decision to use the rioting charge against the 44, who were arrested on or around Des Voeux Road and Connaught Road on July 28. The sources also said Cheng, a barrister with an arbitration background, had directed that all prosecutions arising from protests over the past two months must be cleared by her. The anonymous open letter was the latest in a series of online missives apparently from government lawyers. In Wednesday’s four-page letter, written on DOJ headed paper, the authors said the department should control criminal prosecutions and be free from any interference, as laid out in the Basic Law. The letter went on to accuse Cheng of making political considerations in dealing with recent cases. “She has insisted on prosecuting without sufficient evidence, without a reasonable chance of conviction, and when it was not in the public interest to do so,” it read. Former public prosecutions chief Grenville Cross criticised those behind the letter, calling it a “shocking development” as they had compromised their position. On the DOJ’s decision to give police verbal rather than written advice on the prosecutions, a veteran prosecutor said that this departed from current practice for serious offences handled by the District Court or even the High Court. The conventional approach was to give written advice before taking the matter to court, adding that this was “to ensure prosecutions from public assemblies comply with the human-rights context”. The prosecutor said skipping the written advice could have been “out of a practical need to fast-track the prosecution, with the written advice supplemented later”. Cross said that, although written legal advice was the “more usual” practice, there was no strict rule. “If the evidence is strong and clear, preliminary legal advice can certainly be given on charges, particularly if there is little or no chance of the advice being changed subsequently,” he said. “In such cases, full, written advice will follow in due course.” As of Thursday, the department had given no written advice. A spokesman for Cheng said on Thursday the prosecutors’ accusations were “groundless” and “regrettable”. “The secretary for justice has the constitutional responsibility to make decisions on and supervise criminal prosecution work,” he said. “Prosecution decisions must be based on objective and professional analysis of evidence obtained and applicable law, as well as the Prosecution Code, there would not be any political consideration. The secretary has always been following these principles in handling all cases.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020962/hong-kong-riot-charges-pushed-ahead-without-justice-chiefs
"Hong Kong protests: heavy jail sentences for rioting will not solve city’s political crisis, former Civil Human Rights Front convenor says",Johnson Yeung among 49 people arrested on Sunday night and held for 48 hours at Kwai Chung Police Station; He describes scenes of distress in jail as first detainee revealed rioting charge and accuses police of abusing their power,"12:46pm, 1 Aug, 2019","Yeung was one of four people released on bail without charge, pending further inquiries, but 43 other protesters – most of them under 30 and including 13 students – became the first batch of participants of the extradition bill demonstrations to be formally charged for rioting, an offence punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment.; Yeung pointed out protesters arrested during the Mong Kok riot in 2016 had still returned to the streets for recent demonstrations.; He called on people to stay unified and voice their opposition against the government by every means possible, through joining strikes and peaceful rallies.","Throwing young protesters behind bars on rioting charges will not solve Hong Kong’s political crisis, a former convenor of the city’s annual pro-democracy march has said, recalling how some of the 43 defendants remained undeterred after their arrests. Johnson Yeung Ching-yin, from the Civil Human Rights Front, was among 49 people arrested during Sunday’s protest – deemed illegal as it had not received police approval – in Central and Western district on Hong Kong Island. One failed to show in court and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. “The government is trying to deter protesters with heavy rioting charges … but it only shows the government is not going to reconcile with society and solve the political crisis,” Yeung said on a radio programme on Thursday morning. “We have to use every means possible to let the government know we will not be scared and retreat.” Among those charged with rioting was a couple who will get married on Sunday. They were only at the scene helping a girl who fell to the ground, their lawyer said on Wednesday. Barrister Billy Li On-yin, convenor of the Progressive Lawyers’ Group, said those who took part in the protest but did not act violently could still be charged with rioting, saying the key was whether one was believed to have been part of an unlawful assembly. Under the Public Order Ordinance, anyone taking part in an unlawful assembly that constitutes a breach of the peace, is seen as being riotously assembled. Yeung was held in custody with other protesters at Kwai Chung Police Station for 48 hours, and recalled most were only notified they would be charged with rioting, not the lighter charge of taking part in unlawful assembly, after more than 40 hours. “The prison turned dead silent after the first one came out and shouted ‘rioting’,” Yeung said, describing the scene as detainees were taken from the cells one by one to be informed of the charges they would face. “Some were weeping, saying: ‘What am I going to do? I am only 20.’” Yeung said, his voice trembling. “Being charged for rioting means the youngsters will probably be locked up for five to 10 years … I feel the authorities are trying to spread white terror to deter us.” Though many feared for their future, Yeung said others remained strong and vowed not to back down and to continue taking part in lawful rallies and protest marches. “We should not allow the government to deprive youngsters their freedom like this,” Yeung said. “The government needs to solve its own political crisis. The solution is not to throw everyone behind bars.” Recounting his 48 hours in custody, Yeung also accused the police force of abusing their power. The protesters were ordered to sit on hard plastic chairs in an indoor car park with poor ventilation for more than 20 hours, he said, with demands to call families rejected for too long.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020905/hong-kong-protests-heavy-jail-sentences-rioting-will-not
Chinese army’s Hong Kong chief says troops are ready to protect nation’s sovereignty,Commander of People’s Liberation Army’s Hong Kong garrison comments on Hong Kong for first time since protests against extradition bill began in June; Garrison releases three-minute propaganda video that includes anti-riot drills and refers to Hong Kong,"10:28am, 1 Aug, 2019","Chen’s comments marked the first time he had commented on Hong Kong since protests erupted in early June against the city’s controversial extradition bill. The bill proposed the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition agreement, including mainland China.; Hong Kong and mainland government officials said the vandalism of the central government’s liaison office building in Hong Kong on July 21 – during which the national emblem was sprayed with graffiti – should not be tolerated. They described the protesters as radical and extreme.","The chief of the Chinese military garrison in Hong Kong has spoken for the first time about the ongoing unrest in the city, warning that violent clashes would not be tolerated and that the army was determined to protect China’s sovereignty. Chen Daoxiang, the commander of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) Hong Kong garrison, made the warning at a reception in Hong Kong celebrating the 92nd anniversary of the Chinese military on Wednesday, when the garrison also released a promotional video showing various activities and stating that troops stationed in the city were able to protect its long-term stability. One of the scenes in the video features a soldier shouting in Cantonese during an anti-riot drill: “All consequences are at your own risk.” “Recently, there have been a series of extremely violent incidents happening in Hong Kong,” he said at the reception, held at the garrison’s central barracks in Admiralty on Hong Kong Island. “This has damaged the prosperity and stability of the city, and challenged the rule of law and social order. The incidents have seriously threatened the life and safety of Hong Kong citizens, and violated the bottom line of ‘one country, two systems’,” he said. “This should not be tolerated and we express our strong condemnation.” Chen said the garrison resolutely supported Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the city’s police in maintaining law and order. “We resolutely support the action to maintain Hong Kong’s rule of law by the people who love the nation and the city, and we are determined to protect national sovereignty, security, stability and the prosperity of Hong Kong,” he said. The PLA would adhere to the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, as well as to the Hong Kong Garrison Law and the direction of the Central Military Commission, headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Chen said. Lam and Hong Kong’s former leader Tung Chee-hwa both attended the reception. The Hong Kong garrison released a three-minute video on Wednesday, showing anti-terrorism and anti-riot drills. Tanks are mobilised in some of the drills. In an anti-riot exercise, troops are seen marching with a red warning flag telling rioters to “stop charging, or we use force”. “All consequences are at your own risk,” a solider yells. Concerns over whether the PLA could become involved in maintaining order have been heightened with protests continuing in Hong Kong against the now suspended extradition bill. Some of the protests have ended in violent clashes. The Hong Kong government said earlier that the city was fully capable of dealing with its own affairs and maintaining public order, and there was no need for help from the garrison. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times, a mainland tabloid newspaper published under People’s Daily, said last week that troops should be deployed in Hong Kong only in the event of the city being turned into an anti-China base by the US, a humanitarian disaster, or armed riots by radicals trying to take control of the city’s nerve centre.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020881/chinese-armys-hong-kong-chief-says-troops-are-ready-protect
Supporters find ways to feed mostly young Hong Kong extradition bill protesters amid concern some are ‘fighting on empty stomach’ after buying protective gear,"Viral appeals online spark wave of generosity in the form of donated items, as well as food and shopping vouchers for frontline demonstrators; Help includes job-matching platform for those arrested and out on bail","9:30am, 1 Aug, 2019","Chen’s comments marked the first time he had commented on Hong Kong since protests erupted in early June against the city’s controversial extradition bill. The bill proposed the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition agreement, including mainland China.; Hong Kong and mainland government officials said the vandalism of the central government’s liaison office building in Hong Kong on July 21 – during which the national emblem was sprayed with graffiti – should not be tolerated. They described the protesters as radical and extreme.","Some Hongkongers have been exploring ways to feed extradition bill protesters through donated food coupons and meal vouchers, following appeals made online that the mostly young demonstrators have little money left after buying protective gear. The requests, which have gone viral since Monday, sparked generous contributions from supporters, who sympathised with what they saw as weary protesters staging demonstrations that lasted hours on end. The rallies have increasingly ended in violence and deepened social divides, as escalating tensions led to clashes between protesters and police, with officers using tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse crowds. One volunteer group, which spoke to the Post, said they had collected HK$200,000 worth of coupons which can be used in shops including food outlets, bakeries, and supermarkets, as well as prepaid Octopus cards and masks. “We have been on the front line, and we have seen situations like five protesters sharing a box of takeaway rice,” said Peter Lam, one of the volunteers. “Many frontline protesters have already spent plenty of money buying protective gear, but they give lower priority to [addressing] their hunger,” Lam said. Protesters have taken to wearing goggles, helmets and gas masks to prepare for confrontations with riot police. A full set of such gear can cost a few hundred Hong Kong dollars, depending on the level of protection. Other standard field items brought by protesters include umbrellas, eye drops, cling film and first aid materials. Supporters said the cost for such products, which might have to be replenished, were a burden for those who were still students. Lam was coordinating his action with a group of roughly 30 volunteers to collect donated items by a street booth. Since Tuesday, they have received coupons for different shops and other materials. Lam said the donations would be distributed to protesters on the front lines in coming events, as well as through the student unions of universities. To avoid falling foul of the law – 44 people have been charged with rioting – online users were careful with their choice of words when mobilising support for protesters. In some posts on social media or online forums, protesters were called “children” while those showing support termed themselves “big brother”, “big sister”, “dad” or “mum”. A designer who only gave his surname as Tsang also said he initiated a similar drive. Tsang, who gives food vouchers to the elderly, said he had been collecting coupons of fast food and bakery chains. “This is an action to show that Hongkongers are really concerned about [the political crisis],” Tsang said. “Some people are unable to go to the front line, but they still want to help.” He said his coupons would be handed out to protesters through social workers, church pastors and other volunteers taking part in demonstrations. Kan Wan-yan, 34, a bank employee, said she cried when she heard that frontline youngsters at the protests had to “fight on an empty stomach”. “The next day I went to buy 20 $100 Wellcome [supermarket] coupons for them,” she said. “I asked around among friends to see what was the best way to deliver the coupons, but it seemed they were asking the same question too! A group of people claiming to be employees of HKTVmall, an online retail platform, also threw their support behind such actions. They are planning to allow protesters to anonymously collect items paid by staff at the outlet’s pickup points across the city. Other forms of support that have emerged include an online job-matching platform for protesters who are arrested and released on bail. On popular online forum LIHKG, some protesters shared how they encountered acts of kindness from strangers. “When we were eating in a restaurant the other day, our bills have been secretly paid for by [people] sitting next to us, who must have heard our conversations. I really felt like crying,” one user posted. The user also said his friends’ parents did not support the protest and would not give them food if they stayed out late. But the user added that protesters still preferred items such as masks, goggles, helmets and gloves, instead of being invited for a free meal as they did not know who to trust. “Please do not ask us to accept cash, we have our dignity and pride too,” the user wrote, stressing that they were thankful for the support. But not all residents in the city were as supportive – non-cooperative movements on the MTR network during the morning rush hour received mixed reactions from passengers. On Tuesday night clashes broke out at police stations in Kwai Chung and Tin Shui Wai, where the force said 23 officers were assaulted by protesters and splashed with corrosive liquid.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/society/article/3020848/supporters-find-ways-feed-mostly-young-hong-kong-extradition
Hong Kong bankers join call for citywide strike over handling of outcry over extradition bill,Nearly 400 staff from across more than 30 institutions join up with unions in calling for action on Monday; Organisers demand inquiry into government’s recent performance over controversial extradition bill,"8:30am, 1 Aug, 2019","Civil servants, meanwhile, got the go-ahead from police to host an unprecedented rally on Friday evening in Chater Garden to urge the government to respond to the demands of protesters against the now-abandoned extradition bill.; The idea of a strike was first floated weeks ago on an online forum, and has gained momentum after two protests that descended into clashes over which 44 people have been charged with rioting.","Hundreds of workers at 34 banks joined calls for a citywide strike next week against the government’s handling of recent unrest which has rocked Hong Kong. The finance staff added their voices to an umbrella group of 95 unions from the public and private sectors behind the action planned for Monday. The appeal from the pro-democracy Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU) and staff from local banks, including international investment banks and Chinese state-owned banks, was also echoed by teachers and art groups. “To really allow the city to settle down, the government should establish an inquiry, which is not just about the police’s handing of protests, but the entire policymaking and decision-making process,” CTU chairwoman Carol Ng Man-yee said. “We hope all working staff will take part, and join one of the seven rallies over the city.” She was referring to the parallel rallies proposed online for Monday in Admiralty, Mong Kok, Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan, Tai Po, Wong Tai Sin and Tuen Mun. It was unclear whether there was any organiser behind the plan, or whether anyone had applied for permission from police. Ng did not estimate how many unions would take part, noting some were still discussing the idea. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, a major union with 100,000 members, was likely to join the strike, the Post has learned. The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation also supported the cause in principle. The controversy surrounding the extradition legislation, and the subsequent police response to protests against it, is showing no sign of dying down, while more sectors have joined calls for its complete withdrawal and an independent inquiry into the debacle. Nearly 400 employees at 34 financial institutions launched an anonymous petition to support the Monday strike, as well as scheduling a brief protest in Chater Garden for Thursday evening. “We urge the government to respond to the key demands from the public, and stop the market turbulence,” read a post on popular forum LIHKG. Staff from HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and UBS were among those who backed the call, some posting pictures of their staff cards, with their names covered. Five workers from the state-owned Citic Bank posted a message which read: “Useless government ignores the people’s will. All Hongkongers let’s go on strike on August 5.” One of the petition organisers said the saga had already taken a toll on the finance industry, with some private banking clients already shifting assets to neighbouring economies, such as Singapore and Taiwan. “I am never a political person, but the government’s way of handling the situation has only triggered more opposition,” one HSBC veteran, known as CH, said. “If this carries on, we will see investors and our talents leaving this city.” While industrial action is legally protected, employment lawyer Michael Szeto of law firm ONC Lawyers warned political protest or pursuing personal ideals were not legitimate reasons for industrial action and so not protected. He said taking a day off without good reason could “attract the risk of disciplinary action”, although it was unlikely to trigger a summary dismissal. Chan Chiu-wai, the head of the CTU’s civil service team, said civil servants from various departments would consider taking a day off to join the rally. “They are aware that the law does not provide sufficient protection. That’s why there’s understandably some concern from colleagues,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020850/hong-kong-bankers-join-call-citywide-strike-over-handling
US-based Hongkongers ask United Nations to help resolve extradition bill crisis,Group of 10 students and professionals gather outside UN headquarters in New York; Crowdsourced letters say rule of law has broken down in the city and call for international intervention,"6:24am, 1 Aug, 2019","Civil servants, meanwhile, got the go-ahead from police to host an unprecedented rally on Friday evening in Chater Garden to urge the government to respond to the demands of protesters against the now-abandoned extradition bill.; The idea of a strike was first floated weeks ago on an online forum, and has gained momentum after two protests that descended into clashes over which 44 people have been charged with rioting.","Hongkongers in New York on Wednesday hoped to turn global attention to the escalating violence that has increasingly marred protests in their home city by trying to deliver a letter to the United Nations Security Council. Dressed in black on a hot muggy day to show solidarity with the protesters, a group of 10 Hongkongers – students and professionals, most of whom had never met each other before – gathered in front of the UN headquarters in Manhattan and shouted “Stand with Hong Kong!” Then they entered the building with variations of a letter calling for aid they hoped would find their way to the Security Council, as well as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Office of the Committee Against Torture. “The breakdown of the rule of law – guaranteed to us by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the cornerstone of any functioning society – means that we can no longer rely on our political institutions to provide effective remedies. As such, we urgently request assistance from the international community to address the situation,” the letter to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, shared with the South China Morning Post, said. Hong Kong has been rocked by a spate of protests since early June over the government’s now-abandoned plan to pass a bill that could see criminal suspects transferred to jurisdictions the city does not have extradition agreements with, including mainland China. The relationship between police and the public has also been soured by clashes with protesters, who have accused officers of using excessive force and have called on the government to set up an independent inquiry. The letters were crowdsourced via a Google doc from about 30 people around the world, one member of the New York group estimated. Fearful of being infiltrated by authorities, whether in Beijing or Hong Kong, the group in New York said they worked using encrypted chat rooms and aliases to protect themselves. The group, which has no formal name, signed the letters: “Yours faithfully, A group of concerned Hongkongers”. More photo opportunity than a real delivery, Joy Ming King, a 22-year-old student at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, tried to hand the letters to a UN security guard at the headquarters’ information booth. Before the group left, another member persuaded a UN employee working in the main reception hall to accept the packet of letters addressed to human rights officer Thierno Souleymane Adenhof and place them into the UN mail system where they could be screened for security before delivery. “I’m not an organiser, just one of many volunteers. We don’t really know each other. We all work anonymously online and communicate through encrypted chat groups. That is how this entire movement has been organised,” King said. The group was not taking instruction from any person or group, but was in touch with people in Hong Kong as well as others around the world, he said. King and others in New York said copies of the letters were also being hand-delivered by a compatriot in Geneva, Switzerland, to a UN official there. Attempts to reach the UN press office in Geneva via email and phone calls to confirm receipt of the letters were not immediately successful. The New York protesters, some of whom requested their last names not appear, said they were concerned for their own safety but also the safety of family members in Hong Kong. “The people leading this movement in Hong Kong are young, they are all born after the handover and all they know is life with Beijing influence. And yet, they still want to fight for freedom and democracy,” said Brian, a 41-year-old who moved to New York for school 20 years ago. The protests showed circumstances had reached a tipping point in the city’s history, requiring activism, he said. “The Hong Kong DNA is to work hard, cause no trouble and look at social justice as a high-water mark,” he said. However, “it is no longer enough to be a quiet ‘good citizen’”. Toni, who said she was a college student in New York, said: “I’m not an activist, I’m just a common citizen who never imagined herself taking part in this kind of movement.” Still, “there is a huge fear of the ‘white terror’, which is why I don’t want my full identity revealed because officials in Hong Kong are starting to prosecute people, and there are threats made against protesters”, she said. Toni described white terror as the fear of reprisals by armed gangs or the police, arrest or threats of violence. This fear has grown after gangs of men in white shirts indiscriminately assaulted anti-government protesters returning from a mass rally as well as bystanders and even terrified train passengers in the Yuen Long subway station on July 21. Frontline police officers have also been accused of using excessive force while dispersing protest crowds and clashing with radical demonstrators in recent days. Katherine Baldenius, a television commercial producer based in New York, said she was concerned about freedom in Hong Kong. She and her family left in 1987 because they were concerned about the city’s eventual handover from Britain back to mainland China, which took place on July 1, 1997. “Like everybody else, I’m just heartbroken by what is happening in Hong Kong. I felt helpless and wanted to be involved somehow,” she said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/article/3020864/special-delivery-us-based-hongkongers-bring-their-concerns-united
Hong Kong police left ‘dejected and discouraged’ by corruption watchdog’s investigation over violent Yuen Long attacks,Independent Commission Against Corruption reportedly set to look into allegations of misconduct; But some officers want leaking of investigation to be subject of its own inquiry,"10:00pm, 31 Jul, 2019","Civil servants, meanwhile, got the go-ahead from police to host an unprecedented rally on Friday evening in Chater Garden to urge the government to respond to the demands of protesters against the now-abandoned extradition bill.; The idea of a strike was first floated weeks ago on an online forum, and has gained momentum after two protests that descended into clashes over which 44 people have been charged with rioting.","The investigation by Hong Kong’s corruption watchdog into allegations of police misconduct over the violent Yuen Long mob attack has left some members of the embattled force dejected, while a police association asked how the supposedly confidential inquiry had been leaked. But even as officer morale takes a hit from the move by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), which was created in 1974 as the city was going through a period of rampant police corruption, critics doubt that the investigation will cool public anger against the force. According to sources, the ICAC has set up a dedicated group to look at claims that police colluded with the men who attacked anti-government protesters and passers-by indiscriminately at the Yuen Long MTR station on the night of July 21. Protesters remain angry that it took the police so long to arrive at the scene, and that when they did, the estimated 100 attackers had already left the station. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior police officer said: “We are now in the middle of an operation to restore social order. But our colleagues are being investigated for misconduct. “We are unhappy, but there is nothing we can do. We can’t stop the probe. The ICAC is also doing their job in response to a complaint.” A middle-ranking police officer, who also wished to remain anonymous, said the corruption watchdog had overreacted by launching the investigation. “Colleagues are feeling dejected and discouraged because we feel the swift and high-profile intervention by the ICAC is out of proportion,” he said. Lam Chi-wai, president of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, which represents 25,000 of the city’s 30,000 officers, wants the leak investigated. “If this investigation indeed exists, and that it was leaked, then I believe a probe should be conducted to look into the leak. That is needed to ensure the public’s confidence in the confidentiality of the ICAC’s probe,” Lam said. He declined to talk about the impact of the investigation on officers, while police also declined to comment on the matter. Hong Kong has been rocked by a spate of protests since early June over the government’s now-abandoned plan to pass a bill that could see criminal suspects transferred to jurisdictions the city does not have extradition agreements with, including mainland China. The relationship between police and the public has been soured by clashes with protesters, who have accused officers of using excessive force and have called on the government to set up an independent inquiry. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, China’s cabinet, on Monday heaped praise and threw its support behind Hong Kong’s embattled police force in a surprise news conference. During a regular daily briefing on Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying urged journalists not to point their cameras only at police, but at the violence by protesters to ensure that images presented to the world were more comprehensive and accurate. Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who is a former ICAC investigator, did not think that the watchdog’s inquiry could soothe public anger towards police, because it would only look into the conduct of officers in Yuen Long on July 21, and not at their conduct since protests erupted last month. “The whole controversy of the police’s approach to protesters is much bigger than only what happened in Yuen Long,” Lam said. Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu agreed that the investigation would not calm the anti-police sentiment at this stage, and said the public remained sceptical of the agency when it came to sensitive cases. The ICAC was set up in 1974 by the government to crack down on rampant corruption in the city, and during its early years it was despised by many citizens, civil servants and police officers who missed the extra money from pay-offs. In 1977, dozens of police officers stormed the ICAC offices, punching staff. But over the years, the watchdog has taken on many cases of police corruption. According to its annual reports, 14 police officers were convicted for corruption or related charges in 2000, 11 in 2010, and three last year.

A spokesman for the US consulate in Hong Kong said Hua’s statement was “ridiculous”.; He did not touch on the demand made by protesters, as well as some former officials and business groups, for a commission of inquiry to examine the causes of the mass protests.","Former Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa has accused the United States and Taiwan of orchestrating the “well-organised” recent protests against the Hong Kong government. He said he remained firmly behind the Hong Kong police and Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. He called on Lam’s government to listen to public opinion and solve long-standing problems such as housing, health care, education and pensions. “Some young people have vented their anxiety and helplessness through street politics. Yet, with Beijing’s backing and various sectors’ support behind the government, we are capable of breaking the social deadlock,” he said. Tung, who served as the city’s first chief executive from 1997 to 2005, was making his first public comments since protesters besieged Beijing’s liaison office on July 21 and defaced the national emblem with black paint.﻿ “As the legislative process ended, the protests should come to an end,” he said, adding that the unrest had taken a toll on the city’s retail, catering and tourism sectors, as well as its small and medium-sized businesses. Tung said that, rather than being truly leaderless, the protests highlighted that foreign politicians and anti-China forces had been seeking to destroy Hong Kong’s relationship with the mainland. “This storm escalated quickly and it was well organised. We have reasons to believe there were masterminds behind the storm,” he said. “There could be interference from external forces, and various signs are pointing towards Taiwan and the US.” Tung said four principles must be upheld as society seeks to end the extradition crisis: Hong Kong’s stability cannot be destroyed, public opinion cannot be ignored, violence cannot continue, and national sovereignty cannot be challenged. “When the slogan ‘Oppose the extradition bill’ became ‘Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times’ – where would these acts, which challenge the central government’s authority, bring Hong Kong? We absolutely cannot compromise with those who seek to destabilise and divide the city,” he said. He added that there was nothing to protect people’s rights if the “one country, two systems” principle were destroyed. “All peace-loving residents should draw a line between themselves and violence, and support the police’s strict law enforcement,” he said. Tung called on politicians to come up with policies to stabilise the situation. After the lunch, Tung was asked if such a commission should be set up. He sidestepped the question and only thanked journalists for attending the lunch, which was held despite a typhoon signal No 8 warning issued at 1.40pm.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020829/former-hong-kong-leader-tung-chee-hwa-accuses-united-states
US-China trade war brings Hong Kong’s economic expansion to near standstill,Advanced estimates see city report 0.6 per cent year-on-year growth for second quarter; Future remains uncertain with civil unrest hurting retail and tourism sectors,"4:59pm, 31 Jul, 2019","Tung, vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, also warned on Wednesday that there could be no compromise with those who challenge Beijing’s sovereignty and damage the city’s stability.; The former chief executive said he was confident Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of China and “Asia’s central city”, could overcome challenges under Beijing’s “one country, two systems” governing principle.; Tung’s remarks came as he addressed more than 100 business leaders, professionals and pro-Beijing politicians at a lunch organised by the Our Hong Kong Foundation, a think tank he founded and chairs.; He opened his speech saying he felt sad about the recent protests, which were triggered by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China.; Last week, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, urged the US to “retract its black hand from Hong Kong”. A spokesman for the US consulate in Hong Kong said Hua’s statement was “ridiculous”.; He did not touch on the demand made by protesters, as well as some former officials and business groups, for a commission of inquiry to examine the causes of the mass protests.","Hong Kong’s economic expansion has ground to a near standstill, with the city reporting a 0.6 per cent year-on-year increase in gross domestic product under the weight of the US-China trade war, lower than market expectations. Advanced estimates released on Wednesday reported an identical growth rate to that of the first quarter. The economy remained sluggish after the first three months of the year, when the city posted the smallest quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2009. Hong Kong’s economic future for the third quarter is plagued by even greater uncertainty, and business groups said the extradition bill protests, which show no signs of slowing, had hurt the local retail and tourism sectors. The city’s commerce minister Edward Yau Tang-wah warned of the risks of an economic downturn after meeting business representatives. “The updated situation everyone reported showed that the local economy had rapidly and negatively declined. This is more or less due to the social sentiment, and the overall poor environment,” Yau said. The official said the economic figures reported for the first six months only reflected the impact of macro factors, such as the trade war and the global economic performance, but effects of the local protests might be shown between the third and fourth quarters this year. He said tourist numbers had dropped in the third week of July, the first time in more than six months. China, the world’s second-largest economy, has been the target of increased tariffs by US President Donald Trump for more than a year, with Chinese goods valued at more than US$250 billion now covered by 25 per cent tariffs. Though Hong Kong remained protected by a separate economic arrangement under the US-Hong Kong Policy Act, the local trade sector could not escape unscathed. The arrangement was enacted in 1992 based on the principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration ahead of the handover of Hong Kong’s sovereignty to China in 1997. The city, which has served as the re-export hub between the two nations for decades, and whose biggest trade partner is China, is inevitably sandwiched between the two sides. Commenting on Wednesday’s estimates, a government spokesman said external demand weakened further and domestic demand stayed sluggish. The total export of goods dropped 5.4 per cent in real terms from the same period last year, while private consumption expenditure grew 1.2 per cent. Gross domestic fixed capital formation declined significantly, by 12.1 per cent. “Hong Kong’s total exports of goods showed an enlarged decline in the second quarter in tandem with the further setback in manufacturing and trading activities in Asia, amid softening global economic growth and US-China trade and technology tensions,” the spokesman said. Singapore’s GDP for the second quarter was estimated to have increased at a dismal 0.1 per cent from a year earlier. The growth figure for South Korea was 2.1 per cent. The spokesman said local economic sentiment had deteriorated amid increasing downside risks of the global economy and other headwinds, while private consumption expenditure grew only modestly, and overall investment expenditure fell further. The government also noted GDP declined 0.3 per cent in real terms in the second quarter of 2019, compared with the first quarter. Shanghai Commercial Bank head of research Ryan Lam Chun-wang said the market forecast for the GDP growth in the second quarter was 1.5 per cent, and it was disappointing to see the actual figure was lower. Lam said second quarter had a lower base figure than the previous quarter, “but when the rates were the same for the two quarters, that means the underlying momentum is worrying”. For the third quarter, he expected the GDP would grow less than 1 per cent mainly because the trade war raged on. But he added the recent protests would not add much fuel to the fire if there were no further escalation, and pointed to the fact that the 2014 Occupy protests did not have a big impact on GDP. Since June, the extradition bill protests have intensified across the city, with violent clashes breaking out in some of the popular shopping districts. Protesters have demanded a full withdrawal of the legal changes, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city does not have an extradition agreement. Economist Andy Kwan Cheuk-Chiu, director of ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, predicted a more negative scene for the third quarter. He expected the overall year-on-year GDP figure could drop around 0.5 to 1 per cent, with the quarter-on-quarter rate remaining negative. The protests should play a role in affecting private consumption expenditure, he added. The government will announce the revised GDP figures on August 16. Meanwhile, officials reported a deficit of HK$14.8 billion from April to June on Wednesday, and the fiscal reserves stood at HK$1,156.1 billion as of June 30.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3020808/us-china-trade-war-brings-hong-kongs-economic
"Gun-toting officer was in fear for his life, Hong Kong Police say after more extradition bill clashes","The sergeant had been surrounded and had his helmet snatched, force says; Protesters were picketing Kwai Chung Police Station waiting for 44 people charged with rioting to be released on bail","4:20pm, 31 Jul, 2019","Police were also investigating an attack near Tin Shui Wai Police Station in the small hours of Wednesday, when someone in a car with fake licence plates let off fireworks at hundreds of people gathering outside the complex, injuring six.","A policeman pointed a shotgun at a protesting crowd on Tuesday night in fear for his life, after he was surrounded and had his helmet snatched, the force has said. The sergeant aimed the weapon, loaded with beanbag rounds, during clashes in which 23 other officers were assaulted and splashed with corrosive liquid, it added. Hundreds of anti-government protesters surrounded the Tin Shui Wai and Kwai Chung police stations for hours from Tuesday evening, with clashes breaking out at the latter, sparking the gun incident. The police force, suffering soured relations with the public amid a running political crisis, issued two statements to condemn violence at the two protests, stressing that it had the ability to maintain social order. The Kwai Chung clashes happened as hundreds of protesters gathered at the police station and waited for 44 suspects charged with rioting to be released on bail ahead of court appearances on Wednesday. In a statement, the force gave its own account how tensions there escalated. It said that at 9.30pm, when two police vehicles left the station, protesters threw corrosive liquid at officers nearby. An hour later, some officers were sent to Kwai Fong MTR station, where there was a report of an assault. As they returned to the station, the statement read, “two officers were surrounded by a big group of radical protesters, who hurled objects and launched attacks”. “One of them was assaulted by many people. In order to protect his life and personal safety, he raised a long gun loaded with beanbag rounds as a caution,” it continued. “The officer also had his helmet snatched.” Suspected personal details of the officer, and a supposed photo of his family, appeared on social media hours after images of him pointing the gun were widely circulated. The force said 24 officers were assaulted or had corrosives thrown at them in the ensuing fracas, with five sent to hospital. Those facing riot charges were the first batch of protesters prosecuted since a series of demonstrations erupted in Hong Kong in June against the now-shelved extradition bill. The bill would have allowed the city to transfer suspects to jurisdictions with which it lacks a formal extradition agreement, including mainland China, where critics say fair trials are not guaranteed. The Kwai Chung clashes were followed by the conflicts in Tin Shui Wai, where protesters at the police station demanded the release of three men arrested for criminal damage at a “Lennon Wall” peppered with protest-related memos. In a separate statement, police said they received multiple reports of someone driving past the police station and shooting several fireworks at the crowd. Five of the injured were admitted to hospital and later discharged. Another refused to go to hospital. A police source said the car’s number plate had been stolen from another car. In a joint statement, the Hong Kong Journalists Association and the Press Photographers Association strongly condemned “deliberate attacks” on the press by police during the Kwai Chung protest. The groups noted that when officers dispersed the protesters, they were seen hitting an Apple Daily photographer in the head with a riot shield, chasing and beating a female reporter from RTHK who wore a reflective vest with “Press” written on it, and using pepper spray on reporters. The associations said officers had “lost control over their emotions and targeted the press” on various occasions during the weeks of protests. They would lodge serious representations with the government and seek advice on bringing legal proceedings against the force, the statement added.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020802/gun-toting-officer-was-fear-his-life-hong-kong-police

Among those who stood in the dock were a Cathay Pacific pilot, a teacher and 14 students, with the youngest being a 16-year-old girl, and the oldest, a 41-year-old woman. They were charged in connection with Sunday’s protests in Central and Western district on Hong Kong Island, which had been deemed illegal as it did not receive police approval and where radical protesters armed with bricks and metal rods fought with riot police who resorted to tear gas to subdue them. Appearing at Eastern Court in front of a packed gallery on Wednesday, all but two of the defendants were given curfews from or soon after midnight to 6am. Their appearance in court was greeted by hundreds of supporters waving placards and chanting, a few of whom later vandalised a police van. But most were largely peaceful, in marked contrast to the previous night when supporters at Kwai Chung Police Station grew restive and took on officers. The crowds were there to receive the accused, who were awaiting bail. The supporters on Tuesday besieged the station and clashed with police, who later used pepper spray to disperse them after a tense stand-off that lasted well past midnight. Pictures of a station sergeant pointing a Remington shotgun with beanbag rounds at surrounding protesters renewed criticisms of police brutality. But the force responded with a statement on Wednesday setting out how the sergeant was assaulted by protesters, who hurled objects at him and snatched his helmet. The force also said demonstrators had thrown corrosive liquid at officers. The Junior Police Officers’ Association questioned why news of the probe had been leaked, while officers said the ICAC action was another blow to their already battered image. Lam Chi-wai, the association’s president, fired back at ICAC: “If this investigation indeed exists, and that it was leaked, then I believe a probe should be conducted to look into the leak. That is needed to ensure the public’s confidence in the confidentiality of the ICAC’s probe.” Late on Tuesday night and stretching into the small hours of Wednesday, in another incident that left Hongkongers shocked at the escalating violence, protesters outside Tin Shui Wai Police Station who had gathered there after two people were arrested over a “Lennon Wall” fight, had fireworks thrown at them from a passing vehicle. Five were sent to hospital and later discharged, while a sixth refused treatment. While the government kept to its low profile yet again, heads from Education University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), made public their views on the extradition bill crisis that has gripped the city and made international headlines since the first mass protest on June 9. Since then, marches and demonstrations have continued against the now-shelved bill, often descending into chaos and violent clashes between protesters and police. Wei Shyy, HKUST president, called on Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s administration to “demonstrate its courage and leadership” to launch an independent probe into the clashes. Education University head Professor Stephen Cheung Yan-leung, called on Lam to satisfy a demand of the protesters by declaring “the complete withdrawal of the bill” – which she had already announced to be “dead” – and set up an “open platform” represented by various sectors to discuss ways to break the impasse. Curfew exemptions were given for two: one to do overnight shifts at a children’s home, and the pilot to leave the city for work. The rioting offence is punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment. A 44th protester charged with rioting, 22-year-old clerk Yan Hoi-ying, did not appear and the magistrate issued an arrest warrant. Another defendant, student Chen Zimou, 24, a mainlander, was not accused of rioting, but charged with one count of possessing an offensive weapon and also granted bail. The 45 charged – 29 men and 16 women – were among 49 people arrested over clashes between protesters and police after last Sunday’s illegal march. No pleas were entered as police need more time to investigate. Of the remaining four arrested over the clashes, two were released on bail pending further investigation, while another two were temporarily released. After the hearing, supporters of the defendants vandalised an empty police vehicle that had stopped outside the court building. They banged on the outside with their arms, a rod and an umbrella, and pulled off a metal cover protecting the windscreen. One of the 43 defendants, 33-year-old clerk Mok Cheuk-fai, was also charged with assaulting police. The group included 14 students and seven clerks. Others had jobs such as being a chef, nurse, electrician and construction worker. Five were unemployed. The Post learned that most of the defendants were “intercepted” by officers on Des Voeux Road West near Queen Street, Connaught Road Central and Man Wa Lane, during the police dispersal of protesters from 7.45pm to 10.05pm on Sunday. The prosecution also accused them of being equipped with helmets, goggles, gloves, elbow guards, knee pads, masks, cutters, folding knives, spray paint, respirators, umbrellas, cable ties, metal tongs, scissors and hex keys. Chen was accused of carrying an extendable baton without lawful authority or reasonable excuse at Shun Tak Centre in Central, according to court documents. The undergraduate and part-time piano teacher, who has been studying in Hong Kong for four years, later became a target of attack on Weibo – China’s version of Twitter. Mainland internet users flooded his account with abuse for what they saw as his allegiance to Hong Kong protesters. “Revive Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!” some chanted. Selina Yip, 23, who works in the aviation industry, said the charges would only encourage people to take part in more demonstrations. “Since [the defendants] are on the front line, and they have been taken away, we can replace them,” she said, adding the protests did not need to be physical. “We should try something new. Not fighting with police. We need new ways to surprise society and the government.” Student Nathan Chan, 23, said the rioting charge was no deterrent. “It makes me angry and pushes me to do more,” he said. A 22-year-old university graduate who called himself MC Chan said: “Charging 44 people with rioting will not make me protest less. “But I think it’s reasonable to reduce the intensity of actions ... We have caught the whole world’s attention and showed our resolve. It’s unnecessary to stage more violent acts for this purpose.” Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, a co-founder of the pro-democracy Occupy movement, was also among the crowd. “They are all very calm and courageous,” Chu said, with tears in his eyes. “It is disheartening to see them arrested, for we aspire to be a civil society, but the government is using police to crack down on our next generation. It’s just pathetic.” Chu said the government had done little to respond to the key demands of the public, including an independent inquiry into clashes during earlier protests. The extradition bill would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal, including mainland China, where critics say fair trials are not guaranteed.

"Civil servants behind Hong Kong extradition bill protest bombarded by nuisance calls, and targets of complaints to official government hotline",Supporters of Labour Department officer Michael Ngan call on government to protect his rights amid calls to 1823 line; Ngan and co-organiser Cheung Ka-po insist their actions do not break Civil Service Code which requires political neutrality of workers,"9:00am, 31 Jul, 2019","Police were further put on the defensive after reports emerged that the city’s graft-buster, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), was investigating possible police misconduct over their slow response to the Yuen Long incident in which a white-clad mob beat protesters and bystanders.; Inclement weather on Wednesday put a dampener on any protest activity in the evening hours, even as plans gathered pace online for a citywide strike on August 5, and a civil servants rally for Friday at Chater Garden received a no-objection letter from police.; The city’s first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa also spoke on the crisis, putting the blame on interference by Taiwan and the United States.; Outside the court in Sai Wan Ho on Wednesday, hundreds of people gathered to support the defendants, turning up despite heavy rain and wind as the No 3 typhoon signal was in place and the city then bracing itself for an upgrade to No 8.","A civil servant organising a rally for government employees to speak up over the shelved extradition bill has been bombarded with anonymous nuisance calls, and his supporters have launched a campaign to defend him against government supporters’ complaints. In a petition circulated on social media, some internet users claimed the government’s supporters had called the official 1823 hotline to complain about Labour Department officer Michael Ngan Mo-chau, who has been co-organising Friday’s event at Chater Garden in Central. The online petition contained a letter which residents can forward to Carlson Chan Ka-shun, head of the Labour Department, calling on him to protect the rights of Ngan and other civil servants to express their views while off duty. “I hope you can explain how complaints, if any, against Mr Ngan or any other colleague would be handled,” the petition reads. A spokeswoman for the government’s Efficiency Office, which operates the 1823 hotline, said they received an average of 15,000 calls or written notes each day, and had received a similar number of cases on Monday and Tuesday. Apart from complaints with the government, Ngan and another co-organiser, Transport Department employee Cheung Ka-po, also received hundreds of nuisance calls personally. They previously said they expect their rally to attract some 2,000 civil servants, out of the 170,000-strong government workforce. The Civil Service Code does not stop most of the government workforce from joining political activities or groups, but requires them to avoid any conflict of interest under the general principle of political neutrality. Ngan said he did not think his plan would contravene the official code. “Our rally will be objective,” the 29-year-old said. “We just want officials to respond to the people’s demands, we are not opposing the government.” Cheung also said he had received hundreds of calls, but did not regret standing up for his colleagues. “I am just providing a platform for civil servants to express their view after they finished their job, just like the government would organise public consultation meetings. We are not organising a rally to criticise the government,” the 32-year-old said. But Leung Chau-ting, chairman of the 10,000-member Federation of Civil Service Unions, said while the pair might not have broken the code, it would be hard to argue the rally was political neutral. “A key theme of the event will be the extradition bill, which has been so politicised. It would also be difficult for them to guarantee our colleagues’ personal safety,” Leung said, in a reference to violence that took place after recent demonstrations. On the pair’s plan, a spokesman for the Civil Service Bureau said when civil servants express their views in a personal capacity, they must make sure they do not create a conflict of interest with their public post, or cause people to think their impartiality and political neutrality was being undermined. “The civil service is a very important cornerstone for maintaining Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity. We must continue with our professionalism during this difficult time,” the spokesman added. The labour and transport departments both declined to disclose whether they received any complaints directed at the pair, and only said they would follow normal procedures for handling complaints.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020702/civil-servants-behind-hong-kong-extradition-bill-protest
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam seeks support of business bosses at Government House gathering,Chief Executive pledges to spare no efforts in dealing with divisions in society; But business leader said Lam did not elaborate on how she planned to do that,"7:00am, 31 Jul, 2019","Police were further put on the defensive after reports emerged that the city’s graft-buster, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), was investigating possible police misconduct over their slow response to the Yuen Long incident in which a white-clad mob beat protesters and bystanders.; Inclement weather on Wednesday put a dampener on any protest activity in the evening hours, even as plans gathered pace online for a citywide strike on August 5, and a civil servants rally for Friday at Chater Garden received a no-objection letter from police.; The city’s first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa also spoke on the crisis, putting the blame on interference by Taiwan and the United States.; Outside the court in Sai Wan Ho on Wednesday, hundreds of people gathered to support the defendants, turning up despite heavy rain and wind as the No 3 typhoon signal was in place and the city then bracing itself for an upgrade to No 8.","Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has urged foreign and local business leaders to join her in upholding the rule of law and have confidence in the city, as she seeks to galvanise support amid the ongoing protests triggered by her controversial extradition bill. During a lunch at Government House with senior officials and more than 40 businessmen, Lam also pledged to spare no efforts in dealing with disputes in society, and to introduce measures to help companies cope with the risks of an economic downturn. But a business leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the chief executive did not elaborate on how she would solve the current political crisis gripping the city. The lunch came a day after the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) urged Lam to immediately deal with the causes of recent violence and political deadlock, which its members said had taken a toll on business confidence and Hong Kong’s image as a safe place. The Chief Executive’s Office revealed the details of the lunch on Tuesday night, and said the purpose of the meeting was to exchange views on the city’s challenges and opportunities to formulate measures in the upcoming Policy Address, which is expected to be announced in October. “Mrs Lam said that due to the China-US trade friction and uncertainties in the external environment, Hong Kong’s economic momentum has weakened in recent months, with only a modest growth of 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year and no room for optimism for the second quarter and the entire year,” the Chief Executive’s Office said in a statement. “She said that the government … will introduce measures in a timely manner to help companies cope with the economic downside risks.” Lam also said the disputes in society in recent months are not conducive to Hong Kong’s continued development. “Emphasising that the rule of law is the cornerstone of the city’s success and violence is not a solution to any problem, she expressed the hope that various sectors would jointly uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong,” the statement continued. “She pointed out that everyone should continue to have confidence in the city and she firmly believes that with the concerted efforts of various sectors, Hong Kong would find opportunities amid difficulties.” The office said Lam hosted the lunch for the chamber representatives for the first time at Government House this year, to express her gratitude to the business sector for their long-standing support. A local business leader who attended the gathering said the meeting lasted for about 90 minutes. Lam spent the first 15 minutes giving a speech, and spent the remaining time sitting at five different tables to chat with all her guests. “She sounded confident, and repeated that we should look forward. I think the atmosphere was friendly and the business leaders clapped their hands on several occasions,” he said. “Some foreign business people also seemed to understand that Hong Kong’s problems are complicated, and mass protests are not unique to the city.” Top officials from Lam’s cabinet, including Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, as well as the justice, financial, commerce and technological ministers, attended the gathering. The head of one of the city’s largest business chambers said Lam called for the sector to support Hong Kong. He said the city’s leader had again admitted that her administration’s assessment of the public’s reception to the bill had been poor. “She called on the business chambers to have faith in Hong Kong, and promised the government would strengthen support for smaller companies,” said the prominent official, who attended the lunch. “She said Hong Kong’s economy was not in a good shape because of the US-China trade war, and global economic headwinds.” Hong Kong is expected to release it’s preliminary gross domestic product figure for the second quarter of this year on Wednesday. The business leader said most foreign and local chambers attended the lunch, at which they expressed worries that the ongoing anti-government protests would eat into the city’s competitive edge. “The protests might give a perception that Hong Kong is not safe, which in turn may hurt investment confidence and the city’s competitiveness,” he said, adding the protests had already taken a toll on the hospitality and tourism sectors. “The business sector generally dares not to speak up their opposition to the protesters, fearing what they say may end up in backlash.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020713/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-seeks-support-business-bosses
Former US envoy Kurt Tong says Beijing should ‘dial back’ its Hong Kong approach amid unrest,Recently retired diplomat calls on Chinese government to ‘re-establish a little more distance between the rest of China and Hong Kong’; Tong also suggests that China hawks’ growing influence in Washington has led to an exaggeration of concerns about Hong Kong among some in the US,"6:58am, 31 Jul, 2019","Police were further put on the defensive after reports emerged that the city’s graft-buster, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), was investigating possible police misconduct over their slow response to the Yuen Long incident in which a white-clad mob beat protesters and bystanders.; Inclement weather on Wednesday put a dampener on any protest activity in the evening hours, even as plans gathered pace online for a citywide strike on August 5, and a civil servants rally for Friday at Chater Garden received a no-objection letter from police.; The city’s first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa also spoke on the crisis, putting the blame on interference by Taiwan and the United States.; Outside the court in Sai Wan Ho on Wednesday, hundreds of people gathered to support the defendants, turning up despite heavy rain and wind as the No 3 typhoon signal was in place and the city then bracing itself for an upgrade to No 8.","The United States’ recently departed envoy to Hong Kong on Tuesday called on the Chinese government to temper its approach to handling the city’s affairs amid growing concerns among Hongkongers over mainland influence. “The mainland government would be well advised to just kind of dial it back a little in terms of how it approaches Hong Kong affairs,” said Kurt Tong, who retired as US consul general to Hong Kong and Macau on July 5. Tong’s call for restraint from the Chinese government came the same day that Beijing pushed back strongly against similar statements from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accusing the US of being directly responsible for recent violent unrest on Hong Kong streets. He said Beijing should give Hong Kong “the space that it stated that it would in the Sino-British Joint Declaration or in the Basic Law, and re-establish a little more distance between the rest of China and Hong Kong”. Tong’s remarks, delivered at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, came as widespread protests about Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong affairs approach the two-month mark. Violent clashes within the protests, spurred by a now suspended proposal to allow extradition of suspects to certain jurisdictions – notably, mainland China – have escalated in recent weeks, amid confrontations with riot police and coordinated attacks by a mob of counterprotesters that left dozens injured. Tong said it was incumbent on the US government to “be frank ... and be truthful about how we view the situation on the ground in Hong Kong”, but suggested that rising hawkishness against China had led to an exaggeration of concerns about Hong Kong among some US observers. “I do get worried that sometimes people in the United States choose to criticise the situation in Hong Kong disproportionately because it’s China, and because we feel like we’re in a strategic competitive relationship with China, and therefore if we can score a point on Hong Kong, then a mark went up for our team,” he said. Tong was a vocal critic of Beijing during his time as envoy, which began in 2016, straddling the Obama and Trump administrations. Remarks he made in February warning of the risk of Beijing interference in the affairs of Hong Kong, which enjoys executive, legislative and judicial autonomy from the mainland, were criticised by the Chinese government as “distortion and defamatory”. Beijing has stepped up its rhetoric against Washington as tensions in Hong Kong have grown, this week accusing the US government of being directly responsible for recent violence on the city’s streets, after Pompeo said on Monday that “protest is appropriate”. “The reason [Pompeo] is saying that the recent violent incidents are reasonable is that – and everyone might know this – this is the work of the US,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular briefing on Tuesday, ahead of Tong’s speech. As evidence of what she said was Washington’s orchestration of the unrest, Hua pointed to US officials’ recent meetings with members of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy bloc, the presence of “many American faces” at protests as well as some demonstrators brandishing the US flag. “Everyone wants to ask: exactly what role has the US played in the recent series of events in Hong Kong?” Hua said. “On this question, I think the US owes the world an explanation.” Pro-establishment outlets in Hong Kong have jumped on the existence of Caucasian faces in or around protests as proof of foreign interference. A report published in Beijing-loyalist newspaper Ta Kung Pao purporting to expose a foreigner sending intelligence reports to demonstrators about police movement was debunked when it was revealed the person photographed worked for The New York Times and was sending information to a colleague. In a statement last week, the US state department said it “categorically reject[ed]” Beijing’s accusations of interference in the protests. Tong acknowledged on Tuesday that, as a foreigner, his calls for restraint would not be received well by “most Chinese people”. But, he said, “China is capable of subtlety from time to time in its foreign policy – and this isn’t foreign policy, this is actually internal policy. “So I remain hopeful that the message will get through.” His speech on Tuesday was originally scheduled for July 10, but was postponed at the request of the state department. The delay followed a series of similar moves by the Trump administration to pull back on public condemnation of Beijing by officials while the two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks. Before stepping down as the US envoy to Hong Kong, Tong was ordered to water down a speech in which he was expected to condemn the Chinese government over the erosion of the city’s autonomy, according to the Financial Times. And in June, a scheduled speech by US Vice-President Mike Pence criticising Beijing for its human rights record was put on hold indefinitely, with the White House citing “progress” in conversations between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as the reason for the postponement. Asked on Tuesday about the state department’s last-minute postponement of his speech, Tong said the rescheduling was related to “getting clearances and bureaucratic procedures”. “Things always don't go the way they're supposed to,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020725/former-us-envoy-kurt-tong-says-beijing-should-dial-back-its
China’s propaganda machine uses foreign voices to support its stance on Hong Kong protests,State media rolls out interviews with experts to criticise violence and ‘foreign interference’ in internal affairs amid unrest stemming from extradition bill; Language used is aligned with comments made by spokesman for Beijing’s top policy office on Hong Kong affairs on Monday,"10:39pm, 30 Jul, 2019","The language used in the interviews largely echoed comments made by Yang Guang, spokesman for Beijing’s highest office on Hong Kong affairs, at a news conference on Monday, when he called on all sectors of the city to “firmly oppose violence” and criticised some in Western countries for “irresponsible remarks”.; The compilation of remarks on Hong Kong come after eight weeks of mass protests in the city, stemming from a now-shelved extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial.; It is not the first time the state news agency has used foreign opinions to give credit to Beijing’s stance. A July 5 report by Xinhua quoted foreign experts – including Cavince, Asif and Chang – as saying that Hong Kong protesters had seriously hurt law and social order when they stormed the Legislative Council complex on July 1.; Experts from around the globe have also been interviewed by state media to offer supportive quotes on issues such as Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and China’s commitments on trade.","Chinese state media has rolled out interviews with foreign experts to criticise violence and claim outside intervention in the continuing protests in Hong Kong, in a bid to present international support for views aligned with Beijing’s – a tactic favoured by the mainland propaganda machine. Amid a tumultuous summer of protests in the city, the official Xinhua news agency ran a report on Tuesday interviewing six experts from around the world to reject the “violent acts of some extreme radicals” who undermined public order in Hong Kong and to criticise “foreign interference” in China’s internal affairs. Without giving evidence, the Xinhua report cited Kenyan international relations expert Adhere Cavince, Mexico-based China expert Ricardo Chang, and Afghan journalist Hamidullah Arefi as criticising foreign forces for influencing the events in Hong Kong. Nadia Helmy, political science professor at Beni Suef University in Egypt, was quoted as saying: “I believe that some foreign forces are secretly fanning the flames in the events in Hong Kong, trying to create chaos to undermine China’s sovereign interests.” Also in the same article, written with eight reporter bylines, were supportive sentiments from Sudheendra Kulkarni, chairman of the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai, India, and Islamabad-based academic Farhat Asif. Increasing bouts of violence have broken out in clashes between police and protesters, as demonstrators push five key demands, including full withdrawal of the bill and an independent investigation into allegations of excessive police force. As tensions in Hong Kong have intensified, Chinese state media has selectively published reports on the events in the city, with news of mass peaceful protests censored across the mainland. Instead, state outlets have published reports seeking to paint a picture of an international community rallying to its cause. On Sunday, Xinhua carried an interview with Jovan Palalic, general secretary of the Serbian People’s Party, in which he said the violence in the Hong Kong protests should “not be allowed by any country in the world”. Interviewed scholars often hailed from countries with governments that were diplomatically friendly with Beijing, such as Pakistan, Kenya and Egypt. Another Xinhua piece in March praised the “one country, two systems” model in Hong Kong through interviews with foreign scholars from Turkey, South Africa, Ethiopia, Belarus, Indonesia and Uganda.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020707/chinas-propaganda-machine-uses-foreign-voices-support-its
Hong Kong psychiatrists volunteer to help city heal after stress of anti-government protests,"Impact on mental health greater than during the Occupy movement, College of Psychiatrists says; Care4ALL programme will run until February and will focus on those with depression, anxiety, acute stress and PTSD","9:51pm, 30 Jul, 2019","The language used in the interviews largely echoed comments made by Yang Guang, spokesman for Beijing’s highest office on Hong Kong affairs, at a news conference on Monday, when he called on all sectors of the city to “firmly oppose violence” and criticised some in Western countries for “irresponsible remarks”.; The compilation of remarks on Hong Kong come after eight weeks of mass protests in the city, stemming from a now-shelved extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial.; It is not the first time the state news agency has used foreign opinions to give credit to Beijing’s stance.

Describing the mental pressure faced by the city’s residents as more serious than during the Occupy movement in 2014, the Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists announced it would launch the new ‘Care4ALL’ mental health programme next week. The scheme, which will run until February, will aim to provide preliminary assessment and consultation for people suspected mental health problems directly related to the recent social unrest. Lam advised the public to be aware of their own mental state, and that of people around them, and avoid spending too much time on the news, especially on videos that contained violent content. Hong Kong has been rocked by weeks of protests against the controversial extradition bill, which has now been shelved, but would have allowed the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions with which the city has no such agreement, including mainland China. Nearly 1 in 10 people in Hong Kong is likely to have depression, according to an earlier study by the University of Hong Kong – nearly double the number five years ago. “The mental pressure the whole city is facing is unprecedented. Not only the ones who join the protests are facing the pressure, but the whole city,” Phyllis Chan Kwok-ling, a college vice-president, said. As of Tuesday, more than 50 psychiatrists had agreed to participate in the programme, and the college believes that number will rise. “We hope to show that our college’s fellows are in line with the Hong Kong people. We hope to use our professional skills and enthusiasm to help the citizens to get through theses hard times,” Ng said. The college wants to focus its services on those who have been adversely affected by the unrest, but who are not currently under legal investigations or charged with offences, and not been seen by a psychiatrist in the past two years. The cost of a session will range from being free, to HK$800, excluding the medical expenses or other related medical services, depending on a patient’s financial situation. Ng said mental problems caused by social turmoil were usually short-term, and could be cured in three to six months. He said the college would provide the service with a maximum of four sessions. After finishing the four sessions, if patients still need psychiatric treatment, they will be referred for further treatment, under the arrangement of the Hospital Authority.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3020703/hong-kong-psychiatrists-volunteer-help-city-heal
Hong Kong protesters injured in drive-by firework attack from private vehicle after clashes outside police stations,"Demonstrators attacked as they vented anger over Lennon Wall arrests and riot charges, the first of their kind since extradition bill crisis erupted in June; Protesters gathered at stations in Kwai Chung and Tin Shui Wai as emotions ran high","7:44pm, 30 Jul, 2019","The drive-by attack from a private vehicle was launched as protesters besieged two police stations on Tuesday night over the ongoing extradition bill crisis in Hong Kong.; Protesters threw bottles and umbrellas at police officers deployed to locate a man fainted near Kwai Fong MTR station. The officers responded by firing pepper spray at them. #ExtraditionBill pic.twitter.com/SckwAoX00k; — Stella Lee (@StellaLeeHKnews) July 30, 2019; Outside the police station, protesters attempted to trap officers in the building by sticking umbrellas into one of the gates and spray-painting cameras at the entrance. The latest escalation in the political crisis happened as a No 3 typhoon signal was in place.","Six people were injured when fireworks were let off at a crowd gathered outside a Hong Kong police station on Wednesday morning, in an escalation of violence that has shocked the city. At Kwai Chung Police Station, officers used pepper spray on protesters and a sergeant emerged with a Remington shotgun, thought to be loaded with beanbag rounds, in an attempt to clear the crowd waiting for 44 suspects charged with rioting to be released on bail ahead of Wednesday’s court appearances. It was the first such charges in two months of unrest. Tensions also flared at Tin Shui Wai Police Station, where another crowd gathered after two people were arrested at a nearby “Lennon Wall”, on which protesters had posted messages denouncing the government’s now-abandoned bill. At about 2.30am, a vehicle drove past Tin Shui Wai Police Station and let off several fireworks at the crowd, sending people screaming and running for cover. The incident resulted in six injured. A witness told RTHK he was covered in firework residue, adding: “The second or third round exploded near me.” Five of the injured were admitted to Tin Shui Wai Hospital while the remaining person declined medical treatment. The Hospital Authority said on Wednesday morning all five had been discharged. Sources at the scene in Kwai Chung said tensions escalated as a group of officers, responding to reports a man had collapsed nearby, were attacked by protesters and fired pepper spray at them in return. A video clip of the incident showed a station sergeant pointing the Remington gun at the crowd. A police source said it was loaded with beanbag rounds, which had been used to disperse protesters in previous clashes. The source added the sergeant later sought treatment for facial injuries at a local hospital. In a joint statement, Hong Kong Journalists Association and Hong Kong Press Photographers Association condemned police for what they described as the smacking of an Apple Daily journalist in the face with an officer’s shield. An officer also waved his baton in the direction of a Now TV journalist, the statement said, threatening to hit her. Earlier on Tuesday evening, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside Kwai Chung Police Station, many of them masked and in black. They called those arrested “honourable fighters” who were only protecting Hong Kong. Some also hurled verbal abuse at officers in the station. Police officers in riot gear were on guard behind the station’s gates. The stand-off led to scuffles as protesters hurled objects at the station and officers armed with batons and shields tried to disperse the crowd at 10.40pm. Less than 10 minutes later, officers circled back to the station and went inside. Sources at the scene said a group of officers left the station to locate a man who was reported to have fainted nearby. But as soon as the officers went outside, they were surrounded by the protesters, and clashes followed. Christine Kam, a 30-year-old Kwai Chung resident, said she saw a group of officers rush out of Kwai Chung Police Station and go all the way to the nearby MTR station. “An officer was pointing a gun at people … without any warning,” Kam said. “There were also officers spraying pepper spray at people inside the MTR station.” She said she did not see any protesters in the station at the time. A video clip showed officers being chased by protesters, who threw bottles and umbrellas at them near the station. “Police were dispersing people, mostly onlookers and those from the neighbourhood,” Kam said, adding that there were lots of elderly people at the scene. “It was really terrifying. You never think that [such scenes would happen] while you are just standing there to observe and everyone is being peaceful,” she said. By 12.45am on Wednesday, most arrested protesters had been released on bail, and the protesters gathered outside Kwai Chung police station left. But dozens waited outside for one remaining protester. A fight broke out between a man dressed in white and other protesters at 1.08am. Police, armed with pepper spray and shields, eventually restrained the man and took him into the police station with protesters following behind. The group of 44 charged for rioting were among 49 people arrested, comprising 32 men and 17 women, aged between 16 and 41. They were detained during clashes with police in the city centre on Sunday. Among those facing riot charges, a 33-year-old man was also charged with assaulting a police officer. The group will appear at Eastern Court in Sai Wan Ho on Wednesday. Of the remaining five people, two were released on bail pending further investigation, and two were temporarily released. Another suspect, 24, was charged with possession of offensive weapons. Police said an active investigation was under way and the force would not rule out the possibility of further arrests. On Sunday, an approved rally at Chater Garden expanded into an illegal march that ended in running battles between police and protesters in the city centre. Demonstrators hurled miscellaneous objects such as bricks at officers and set fires at various locations, according to police. Officers fired tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades to disperse the crowds. Since June 12 when police first used tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse violent protesters outside the government complex in Admiralty, about 200 people have been arrested in connection with ensuing clashes, as well as the online release of personal information of officers. In Hong Kong, rioting carries a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment under the Public Order Ordinance.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020677/44-out-49-arrested-sundays-clashes-between-extradition
Hong Kong police ‘under investigation’ by corruption watchdog over failure to protect public during Yuen Long attacks,Independent Commission Against Corruption has set up dedicated group to handle probe; ICAC officers have been collecting security camera footage from businesses in the town,"4:02pm, 30 Jul, 2019",Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung sought Tuesday’s urgent meeting after the No 2 official’s apology prompted online protests by anonymous officers and condemnation from two staff associations which accused the government of throwing them under the bus.,"Hong Kong’s corruption watchdog has initiated an investigation into allegations of police misconduct over the force’s much-criticised failure to protect the public from mob violence on July 21 in the northern town of Yuen Long, according to sources. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) had set up a dedicated group to handle the investigation, sources told the Post on Tuesday, even as anti-graft officers were seen collecting security camera footage from shops and businesses in Yuen Long. The official probe would be another blow to the morale of the city’s embattled law enforcers, who have borne the brunt of public rage over the government’s now-abandoned extradition bill, with frontline officers accused of using excessive force while dispersing protest crowds and clashing with radical demonstrators. Critics have also accused police of colluding with those behind the late-night attacks in the Yuen Long MTR station by gangs of men in white shirts who indiscriminately assaulted anti-government protesters returning from a mass rally as well as bystanders and even terrified train passengers. Some of the attackers were suspected triad gangsters. Many have questioned why police did not deploy enough personnel in the area after being warned in advance there was trouble brewing, and only arrived at the scene after the attackers had fled. Top brass have countered that most of their manpower was preoccupied with mass protests on Hong Kong Island that ended in violence the same night, while officers in Yuen Long were busy attending to other emergencies in the district. Two police officers reached the scene at 10.52pm, but only intervened after reinforcements arrived 39 minutes later. Officially, an ICAC spokesman would not confirm the launch of the investigation. “The ICAC has already received complaints from citizens concerning the Yuen Long attacks and will follow up in a serious manner in accordance with the law,” was all the spokesman would say. Staff at a restaurant on Fung Yau Street North in Yuen Long confirmed that ICAC officers had paid a visit at around 6pm on Tuesday, requesting video footage captured by its security cameras. Opposition lawmaker and former ICAC investigator Lam Cheuk-ting, a vocal critic of police action against protesters, said there was enough proof to suggest that law enforcers in Yuen Long had neglected their duty and deliberately allowed the attackers to go on a rampage. “I believe there is strong evidence to question whether the police in charge of Yuen Long District, especially the commander, had committed wilful dereliction of duty … that constitutes the offence of misconduct in public office,” he said. “For such a serious accusation, the ICAC has the appropriate power and a role to conduct an investigation.” Also on Tuesday, 44 out of 49 suspects – aged between 16 and 41 – were charged with rioting after they were arrested during an illegal protest in Western District on Sunday, when radical demonstrators armed with bricks and sharpened rods fought pitched battles with riot police who used tear gas to disperse them. A 24-year-old man was separately charged with assaulting a police officer, while two others were released on bail and the remaining two were temporarily released. The 44 suspects will appear on Wednesday morning at Eastern Court, where their supporters are expected to turn up in force for another potentially chaotic protest. Hundreds surrounded the Kwai Chung police station on Tuesday night, ahead of the expected release of the suspects on bail. Clashes broke out and police used pepper spray against protesters pelting the building front with eggs from outside the main gate. Separately, five out of another 14 people arrested over last Saturday’s illegal rally in Yuen Long, when the town was rocked by more protest violence, appeared in court on Tuesday to face charges of obstructing police or possessing offensive weapons. Eight others were released on bail, including activist Max Chung Kin-ping, 39, who was arrested for “organising an unauthorised assembly”. The remaining suspect was released with a warning for failing to show identification. Earlier on Tuesday, groups representing almost all of Hong Kong’s police officers demanded that the city’s deputy leader make clear to the public what he meant when he apologised for the force’s response to the Yuen Long train station attacks. But one association leader insisted after speaking to Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung that officers stood united with the government. Speaking after the meeting, Ronny Chan Man-talk, chairman of the Superintendents’ Association, said he better understood Cheung’s remarks, though he did not elaborate on what the chief secretary had said. “The police are aligned with the government; we are unified,” he said. Cheung’s boss, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, continued to avoid public appearances, instead hosting a lunch gathering at Government House with senior officials and more than 40 business leaders. She urged the foreign and local business community to support her in upholding the rule of law, while pledging to spare no effort in dealing with the crisis as well as to introduce measures to help companies cope with economic uncertainty.

Who are the young civil servants defying peers and elders by holding a rally against Hong Kong’s extradition bill?,"Plan to gather some 2,000 government employees means putting names on record – and potentially careers at risk; One organiser says ‘I hope we can provide a platform for rational and peaceful exchange”","9:00am, 30 Jul, 2019",Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung sought Tuesday’s urgent meeting after the No 2 official’s apology prompted online protests by anonymous officers and condemnation from two staff associations which accused the government of throwing them under the bus.,"A group of young civil servants have defied pressure from their peers, elders and supervisors to organise the first political rally by government employees over the extradition bill crisis. The plan to gather some 2,000 civil servants was announced on Sunday night at the peak of the latest clashes between anti-government protesters and police in Sheung Wan – and it immediately raised eyebrows. Last week, hundreds of civil servants – administrators, executive officers, clerical staff, disciplinary forces and even government lawyers – issued anonymous petitions urging Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to order an independent inquiry into the escalating extradition bill fiasco. But putting their names on record – and potentially their careers at risk – is different. “Most colleagues involved in the discussion were wary of being named in the public and becoming a somewhat public figure,” said Michael Ngan Mo-chau, 29, a co-organiser of the rally, which is scheduled for Friday at Chater Garden in Central. “But I am not worried about possible retaliation. The promotion of civil servants, after all, is made in accordance to their performance.” Organising a rally was not entirely new to Ngan, who once served as vice-president of Chinese University’s students union. In 2012, he helped organise a class boycott on campus to demand the scrapping of the national education curriculum – but that was his last encounter with social movements. Of 10 fellow members in the student union, only two remained active in local social movements. Ngan was the only one to join the public sector after graduation. He started working for the government in 2016 and now works as an Assistant Labour Officer II. “I have never thought of organising [a rally] for civil servants, but just like this entire movement [against the extradition bill], many have made their first attempts,” said Ngan. Another co-organiser, 32-year-old Cheung Ka-po, said he had been closely following the extradition bill crisis since March, but only decided to take action on July 21 – the night when a mob indiscriminately attacked passengers and protesters in Yuen Long MTR station. “Why did the police fail to show up on time? I’m worried this could hurt citizens’ confidence in civil servants,” said Cheung, who works in the Transport Department. “I hope we can provide a platform for rational and peaceful exchange.” Ngan, Cheung and three organisers – from the highways and housing departments and the Land Registry – came to know each other and other supporters on LIHKG, the social media platform, and set up a group on the encrypted messaging platform Telegram a few weeks ago. Cheung said he had only met Ngan in person once before they announced the plan to hold a civil servants’ rally. He added that they had already received nuisance calls from unknown people. He described himself as a newcomer to social movement. “I have no experience in applying for the letter of no objection [from the police], let alone holding a rally,” Cheung. “I just hope we do not have to do it many times.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020536/who-are-young-civil-servants-defying-peers-and-elders
Ethnic minority groups in Hong Kong harassed and discriminated against amid online rumours pinning blame for Yuen Long attack on them,Community in tense northern town anxious as some members close businesses and others stay home; Tensions fly following arrest of Nepali man in area over ‘possession of offensive weapons’,"8:30am, 30 Jul, 2019",Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung sought Tuesday’s urgent meeting after the No 2 official’s apology prompted online protests by anonymous officers and condemnation from two staff associations which accused the government of throwing them under the bus.,"Ethnic minority groups in Hong Kong have become the target of harassment and discrimination with some forced to close businesses and stay home after internet users suggested members of the community were behind the vicious Yuen Long attack last week. In one case, a group of Nepali men living in Yuen Long suddenly found themselves being confronted by locals on the street on the night of July 21, just an hour after a white-clad mob beat up passengers at the MTR station. The Nepali group was verbally abused, pushed and also accused of attacking civilians, according to community leader Jimmy Singh Baljinder. He said the misunderstanding was directed particularly towards Indian, Pakistani and Nepali residents who live in Yuen Long and New Territories West. In fear of being targeted, many of them did not show up for work, cancelled their social appointments and barely left home. “Many ethnic minority group members are living in fear recently,” said Singh, co-founder of the Racial Integration Education and Welfare Association, an NGO. A 44-year-old Pakistani security guard, who did not want to reveal his real name, said he took a few days off work to avoid harassment in public. He lives with his wife and two children in Yuen Long, and said he would try to stay indoors as much as possible until tensions subsided. “I only go to the supermarket nearby to buy food, and even there I got odd stares from people,” he said. “I feel scared because you can never tell what they are thinking – are they trying to hit you, kick you or are they just angrily looking at you? I tell my children not to go out and play too.” A week ago, violence broke out in the northern town when a group of men with sticks and metal rods stormed Yuen Long MTR station and attacked commuters, seeming to target protesters in black who were returning from an earlier march in the city centre. At least 45 people were injured and 12 arrested over the incident, which further deepened rifts in society. Hong Kong has been rocked by weeks of protests against the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions with which the city has no such agreement, including mainland China. The July 21 attack in Yuen Long, suspected to be by triad gangs, was seen as retaliation against protesters who had occupied streets and disrupted businesses. On the internet, messages circulated that ethnic minority group members were involved in the assault, with one user on popular forum HKGolden claiming: “Sources say South Asians ambushed protesters returning home at Yuen Long MTR station”. On Sunday, police arrested a 30-year-old man of Nepali origin in Yuen Long on the charge of “possession of offensive weapons”. Singh said of the masked attackers: “[They] are unfamiliar to us too. But people may tar us with the same brush and stereotype all dark-skinned people as gangsters.” As for the group of targeted Nepalis, Singh said they were only chatting and drinking beer at a basketball court when some Chinese men showed up and hurled verbal abuse at them. The Nepalis tried to answer in English that they had nothing to do with the attacks, but were asked: “Why did you beat up Hong Kong people?” Singh said the confrontational group continued to push and yell at the men. Singh, who is a fifth-generation Indian resident in Hong Kong, said he was worried that recent events had heightened racial tensions in the city. His NGO had spread the word among ethnic minority communities to warn them against engaging in violent acts, even if they were offered money by triads to do so. Singh added he hoped Hong Kong would remain a tolerant, inclusive society that welcomed people of all ethnicities. Rizwan Ullah, joint secretary of the Pakistan Association of Hong Kong, said he had only heard of some isolated incidents of discrimination, but feared the situation would get worse as social divisions in Hong Kong continued to deepen. “Racial discrimination will get a lot worse if ethnic minorities are actually found and pictured beating up protesters,” he said. “I am still confident Hongkongers will be able to distinguish between a few lawbreaking people and most ethnic minority group members who are law-abiding residents.” Amod Rai, secretary of the Gurkha Cemeteries Trust, a Nepali community group in the city, said most of the mob members seen that night at the station attack appeared to be Chinese. “Although some [ethnic minority] individuals might be involved, we can’t label the entire community,” he said. “We have our long Hong Kong Gurkha history, and have made great contributions and sacrifices [for the city].” According to a 2016 government by-census, there were 584,383 ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong, accounting for 8 per cent of the total population. Between 2013 and last year, there were a total of 397 complaints lodged under the Race Discrimination Ordinance with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the city’s equality watchdog.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/society/article/3020545/ethnic-minority-groups-hong-kong-harassed-and-discriminated
"Hong Kong protests: government unlikely to change its mind on inquiry into extradition bill clashes, sources tell Post",People close to Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s administration exploring possibility of independent inquiry; But police are strongly opposed to prospect and Beijing is not yet pushing for one,"7:30am, 30 Jul, 2019",Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung sought Tuesday’s urgent meeting after the No 2 official’s apology prompted online protests by anonymous officers and condemnation from two staff associations which accused the government of throwing them under the bus.,"People close to the government have been exploring the possibility of launching an independent inquiry into the recent clashes between protesters and police over Hong Kong’s now-abandoned extradition bill, the Post has learned. But a source familiar with the situation said the chance of a government U-turn was slim, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor caught between growing public demands for a commission of inquiry and the police force’s strong opposition to it. A Beijing source closely monitoring developments in Hong Kong said the central government was open to the idea of formally investigating the actions of both protesters and police. But if such a commission was put in place, Beijing would want it to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner, the source said. At a high-profile press conference on Monday, Yang Guang, spokesman for the State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, sidestepped a question by reporters on the possibility of holding an inquiry. He said curbing violence and restoring order remained Hong Kong’s top priority. The establishment of a commission of inquiry is seen as one of the few cards the embattled government can play in response to protesters’ demands, although they specifically want police to be the target because of allegations of brutality. The shelved legislation would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China and other jurisdictions with which the city does not have an extradition agreement. There have been widespread calls for a judge-led commission of inquiry, with former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang throwing his weight behind the move. Two weeks ago, more than 30 leaders from across society called on the administration to launch an independent inquiry into the recent clashes. But Lam would not agree to investigating the police, insisting the matter should be left to the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). On Friday, the four police associations for superintendents, inspectors, overseas inspectors and junior officers, reiterated their opposition to an independent inquiry in a joint letter to the city’s leader. In a commentary published in the Post on Tuesday, former Chinese University vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau Juen-yee wrote that “an independent commission of inquiry of the entire extradition bill affair may help us learn how such crisis may be avoided in the future, and hence may prove worthwhile”. Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman said in a television interview that he supported the idea of an independent inquiry, as it would be the only way to solve the crisis. Responding to such calls on Friday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said while the government believed it was better at this stage to let the IPCC handle the matter, it was fully aware of “a very strong body of opinion” urging the government to establish a commission. “So we are engaged now in a reflective process on the whole issue,” he said. But a government source said the administration had not changed its decision to leave it to the IPCC. “The chief secretary’s remarks on Friday do not contradict the government’s long-standing position,” the source said. Another government source said a U-turn was unlikely. “No matter how wide the scope of the investigation would be, police would unavoidably be targeted in the probe,” the source said. “The decision to set up a commission of inquiry would have been made earlier if we believe it’s feasible.” Professor Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said while Beijing was worried that a commission of inquiry would undermine police morale, Yang Guang had stopped short of ruling it out. Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai said an independent inquiry would be effective in reducing tensions. “I’m worried that confrontation between police and protesters will escalate, as Beijing considers restoring order a top priority,” he said.

Some services were also suspended at Causeway Bay, the city’s shopping heartland. Appealing to protesters, Alan Cheng Kwan-hing, MTR’s general manager for special duties, said: “We understand some people want to express their views but we regret that they did so by disrupting the train service. “We ask them not to obstruct train services and affect other passengers using the MTR.” Cheng said there were 123 incidents of passengers pressing emergency buttons on platforms and in carriages on the Kwun Tong, Tseung Kwan O, Island and Tsuen Wan lines, to obstruct trains. Referring to the possibility of MTR staff downing tools on Tuesday, Cheng said there were so far no cases of train drivers going on strike. “Only one or two drivers called in sick today,” he said. During the height of the disruption, which started just before 8am, traffic was also jammed on roads across Hong Kong Island. Long queues of buses were moving slowly along the Island Eastern Corridor and along Connaught Road from Central to Causeway Bay. Some protesters told the Post they were heading to Hong Kong airport in the early afternoon to join a sit-in proposed for the arrival hall, while others said they would hand out flyers in Mong Kok at 5.30pm. In the first bout of direct action on Tuesday, demonstrators prevented a Whampoa-bound train from departing Tiu Keng Leng station in Kowloon at 7.50am by standing in groups between doors. The train finally left at 9am. Tiu Keng Leng station sits on the Kwun Tong and Tseung Kwan O lines, connecting the densely populated east of Kowloon with the city’s bustling business and shopping hubs. At Admiralty, the city’s administrative hub on Hong Kong Island, about 25 protesters wearing masks stopped train doors closing from around 9.30am. A scuffle broke out briefly between a passenger and protester on the train. The passenger was led off the train by police. An elderly woman was also seen being escorted from the train, with protesters shouting apologies. A 30-year-old clerk, surnamed Chan, said he had been on the platform since 8.15am and was supposed to be at work by 9am. “I support the objectives of the protesters, but it’s not good they are using this method to voice their demands as it inconveniences everyone,” he said. “I really hope this will blow over soon.” As more passengers gathered and remained stuck on platforms at Tiu Keng Leng, the situation got more tense. Arguments and scuffles broke out, with both sides yelling expletives at each other. On Monday night, thousands of people who had joined groups on the encrypted social networking forums on Telegram and LIHKG, discussed the plan. “Some say we need to have political wisdom and not cause trouble at MTR stations, because citizens will not be able to go to school and work,” a message by an administrator of a Telegram group read. “But people are going to criticise you for everything you do – storming the Legislative Council, a sit-in or a protest, there is no need to ask for sympathy or understanding.” A similar campaign took place in Admiralty during morning rush hour last Wednesday. A Chai Wan-bound train left Admiralty station 18 minutes late. “We will closely monitor the situation of all rail links and deploy manpower when needed to minimise disruption to services,” an MTR Corporation spokesman said. “We urge passengers to take note of latest news and plan their itinerary accordingly. We hope passengers will be understanding and we will do our best to minimise service disruption.” Hong Kong has been rattled by protests and several other non-cooperative movements since early June. They were sparked by the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions the city does not have such an agreement with, including mainland China. Protesters have demanded the Hong Kong government completely withdraw the bill and release those arrested in rallies. Transport minister Frank Chan Fan urged protesters not to disturb railway operations, noting the MTR served a daily patronage of more than 5 million people. He said protesters’ actions had created chaos and could cause safety concerns. “I urge friends who want to express their opinions to try and do it through other ways and handle it in a peaceful and rational manner,” Chan said. Police would be restrained in handling the matter as long as opinions were expressed peacefully, he added. Chan said the government had listened carefully to residents and Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had clearly responded to the protesters’ major demands. Demonstrators were also planning a sit-in at the airport at 1pm on Tuesday. Posters being circulated on social media outlined a plan to put up placards to show international travellers their demands, but they would not damage any facilities. A spokesman for the Airport Authority said: “We are closely monitoring the situation. There are clear provisions regarding public order and conduct at the airport.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3020553/hong-kong-facing-rush-hour-chaos-anti-government

In fact, China’s political temperature is at its highest during the dog days of August, when current and retired leaders gather in the popular northern beach resort of Beidaihe to escape the heat of the national capital, and to talk. The resort, located some 300km (186 miles) east of Beijing, provides a relaxed environment for party leaders – particularly the retired ones who still have influence – to exchange their views on major policies. Those views are often absorbed into the formal policymaking meetings that commence in October in Beijing when the weather has cooled. Traditionally, there is no official announcement of the Beidaihe gathering. Instead, observers will note the sudden absence of President Xi Jinping and other senior leaders from state television’s daily news bulletins as a sign that the summer conclave has begun. In recent years, the start of the conclave has also been suggested by reports of senior leaders greeting scientists and academics who have been invited to the resort. It was the Qing government which first used Beidaihe as a summer resort, to entertain diplomats in the late 19th century. Under Nationalist rule, between 1911 and 1949, Beidaihe and Lushan, in southern China, were earmarked as the two major summer resorts for government officials. But Beidaihe only became an important political venue when late chairman Mao Zedong, a keen swimmer, decided to set up a “summer office” there for officials, away from the heat of Beijing. Since then, the resort town has been the birthplace of some historic decisions, including the launch of Mao’s Great Leap Forward and his decision to shell Quemoy island, the closest Kuomintang outpost to the mainland, in 1958. The significance of the summer gathering has diminished under strongman leader Xi. Since his elevation to a status equal to Mao, and superior to all post-Mao leaders – including paramount leaders Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao – Xi has dominated policymaking. Under his leadership, it is widely believed that the influence of retired leaders has also weakened significantly. But most analysts believe Beidaihe still plays a significant role in Chinese politics, giving Xi an opportunity to review and adjust his policies, even though there is little sign of any major challenge to his dominance. This is why the Beidaihe gathering is still keenly watched. Besides spending their leisure time in the sunshine at the beach, China’s leaders also meet frequently at Beidaihe, where they continue to hold the regular weekly gatherings of the innermost Politburo Standing Committee, the monthly Politburo meetings, as well as the discussions of other top party, government and military organs, such as the State Council executive body. Officials from some important central bodies also move into town, ready to be called on to report to, or be consulted by, the top leadership. Representatives from Communist Party departments stay in villas on the western side of an exclusive beach, while State Council cadres stay on the eastern side. “Beidaihe is where and when senior leaders can get together in informal meetings to exchange their views on major policies, and therefore, it still plays a very significant role in policymaking in Chinese politics,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy with National University of Singapore. This year’s meeting will be watched particularly closely, with a host of unprecedented challenges facing the leadership. These include deteriorating China-US relations amid a potentially full-blown trade war; the mass protests in Hong Kong, which communist leaders in Beijing may see as a challenge to Chinese sovereignty; rising pro-independence sentiment in Taiwan; and the sagging economy, which saw growth falling to a record low in the last quarter. Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies with King’s College, London, said he believed the focus of this year’s meeting would be on the general deterioration of the international environment, in particular China-US relations. “I imagine that this meeting will be more focused on external issues than ever before because – to be honest – neither Xi, nor anyone else for that matter, knows what to do about a US under such divided, divisive leadership, where its position at the moment is both a source of opportunity but also a very real danger,” said Brown, who is also director of the college’s Lau China Institute. The gathering comes after more than a year of tit-for-tat tariffs and escalating confrontation between the world’s two major rival powers in almost every area, ranging from technology, ideology and Taiwan to regional and global security. Washington has imposed 25 per cent tariffs on about half of China’s exports to the US and threatened to extend them to all Chinese goods, if the trade talks fail. The US has also launched a technology war, blacklisting several Chinese companies, including the telecoms giant Huawei Technologies. China has retaliated with similar, but more restrained, measures. Despite an agreement to resume negotiations – reached between Xi and his US counterpart Donald Trump at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan – the prospect for an agreement still seems far from certain. In Osaka, both leaders agreed to refrain from imposing new or higher tariffs on each other’s goods, in a similar outcome to their previous meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina in December. But the tariff and technology wars have already damaged both economies and hurt the credibility of the two leaders. A full-blown trade war would be catastrophic, potentially leading to the decoupling of the world’s two largest economies. While there are no clear signs of a challenge to Xi’s authority, there is growing dissent within the establishment over some of his policies. For instance, some officials have made covert complaints about the leadership’s misjudgment of the US administration’s China policy. There has also been some criticism voiced of the party’s inflated propaganda about Chinese achievements on the world stage, its high-profile foreign policy and increasingly assertive defence posture. All of these recent policies, some officials believe, have played a role in the fast-deteriorating relationship between China and the US in recent years. The US-China trade and technology wars have also exposed several unpalatable truths about China’s overinflated sense of national strength, including its weakness in scientific and technological capabilities, its economic vulnerability, and China’s real place on the international stage. Brown predicted that, with no clear answers to the question of how to deal with the challenges of the Trump administration, Xi was likely to spend his summer at Beidaihe listening. “He can’t imagine that the meetings will be about giving instruction, but more about sensing how serious the issues they are facing with the US are, and exactly how to politically respond – just continue to be watchful and respond defensively, or to push forward even more assertively.” Wu said Hong Kong’s ongoing mass protests would also top the leadership’s agenda at Beidaihe, either in formal or informal meetings. For several weeks, the continued mass protests against an extradition bill have evolved into a wider movement with elements against the central government’s control over the former British colony. The demonstrations were originally triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. But they have turned on the central government in Beijing, with some pro-democracy protesters defacing the facade of the central government’s liaison office building in Hong Kong, throwing eggs and splashing black paint on the national emblem of China. The crisis has caught the attention of the global media and triggered widespread criticism in the West, particularly in the US and Britain, over Beijing’s handling of Hong Kong affairs. But China’s leaders may see the protests as the most severe challenge to Chinese rule since the city’s return to its sovereignty in 1997. Beijing is also worried the continuing unrest in the territory may hurt China’s national interest in economics, politics and diplomacy. The leaders are expected to discuss and determine policy measures to deal with the situation during their stay at Beidaihe. As cross-strait ties have plunged to their lowest ebb since Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in 2016, Beijing sees hope for improved relations in a possible changing of the guard in Taiwan’s upcoming presidential elections. The presidential race will not only be a showdown between the self-ruled island’s independence-leaning and Beijing-friendly camps, but also in the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. The Trump administration apparently sees incumbent Tsai and her party as crucial allies in America’s “Indo-Pacific” strategy. Beijing favours Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Han Kuo-yu, the popular mayor of Kaohsiung, who supports the one-China principle, seeing a victory for him as an opportunity for progress in cross-strait relations. Despite the DPP’s crushing defeat to the Beijing-friendly KMT in last year’s local elections, Tsai’s prospects for re-election – and also the prospects for her DPP in the legislative elections – have improved significantly recently due to the party’s standing up to threats from Beijing, as well as its support of the protesters in Hong Kong. With the polls just six months away, Beijing needs to come up with some countermeasures, in an effort to help its favoured party make a turnaround ahead of the crucial elections. China’s policymakers must also discuss measures to overhaul and revive the Chinese economy, not only because the world’s once-fastest-growing main economy registered record low growth in the last quarter, but also because there is no sign of a halt to a 12-year-long downward trend. Growth in the Chinese economy slowed to just 6.2 per cent in the April-June period – the lowest quarterly figure since records began in March 1992. But the world’s second largest economy has been steadily slowing over the past decade, from 14.23 per cent growth in 2007 to 9.5 per cent in 2011, 7.3 per cent in 2014 and 6.6 per cent last year. That downward trend has accelerated quarter by quarter since last year and the latest figures have raised the serious question of when growth may come to a halt, requiring a fundamental overhaul of the state-led economic system, and forceful action by the government. Analysts believe Xi will use the Beidaihe meetings to try and forge consensus among China’s leadership on how to handle the political fallout from the US trade war, Hong Kong protests and other urgent issues. All of these matters are of strategic significance to China’s core national interest and development, related as they are to whether the world’s most populous nation – and last major state under communist rule – can achieve Xi’s most prized accomplishment of the “two centenary goals” – that is, to realise a “moderately prosperous society” by 2021, and to make China a “rich, powerful, democratic, civilised and harmonious” country by 2049.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3020516/seaside-break-no-summer-camp-china-leadership-beidaihe-resort
Beijing tells Hong Kong return to normality ‘the most pressing priority’ in response to unrest and protests that followed extradition bill controversy,"Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also heaps praise on city’s police force, which is under fire over its handling of anti-government protests; Spokesman Yang Guang reiterates support for embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam and urges public to oppose use of violence","11:51pm, 29 Jul, 2019","The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China’s cabinet, struck a measured tone in responding for the first time to the escalating social unrest gripping the city since June, triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill.; When asked about the possibility of the People’s Liberation Army being called in, Yang would only say the basis for such a deployment was outlined in the Basic Law and Garrison Law.; He rubbished allegations of collusion between police, mainland officials and a group of gangsters who indiscriminately attacked protesters, commuters and journalists in the northern rural town of Yuen Long on July 21.","Beijing made it clear to Hong Kong on Monday that a return to law and order should be “the most pressing priority”, and praised the city’s beleaguered police officers in an unprecedented show of support, despite heavy public criticism over allegations of excessive force used against anti-government protesters. Beijing’s eagerness to ease tensions and see the city returning to normality was evident at the HKMAO’s first press conference on Hong Kong since its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Office spokesman Yang Guang reiterated the central government’s support for embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and urged the Hong Kong public to oppose the use of violence. But the most striking part of the 40-minute press conference was the HKMAO’s undiluted praise for Hong Kong police, who are grappling with criticism from all sides for their handling of the massive, often violent, anti-government protests. “We understand the huge pressure facing the Hong Kong police and their families, and would like to salute the Hong Kong police who have been fearlessly sticking to their posts and fulfilling their duties against all odds,” Yang said. Protests in Hong Kong had gone “far beyond the scope of peaceful marches and demonstrations”, he noted, and had undermined the city’s prosperity and stability. Yang, however, did not use the words “riots” or “rioters” to describe the civil unrest in the city. Even those who defaced the national emblem and spray-painted anti-Chinese slogans on the central government’s liaison office building in Sai Ying Pun last week were merely described by him as “a small number of radicals”. Instead, he focused on appealing to Hong Kong people to defend the rule of law as a core value of the city and a cornerstone of its success. “We must not sit idly by and let a small number of people trample on this important value,” he said. “No matter how noble their self-claimed goal is, what is illegal is illegal. We must oppose violence and support police to take action.” Escalating social unrest in Hong Kong has grabbed headlines around the world and thrust the city into the global spotlight. For three consecutive weekends, riot police have battled protesters in some of the world’s busiest urban areas. By inviting journalists around the world to its unprecedented press conference, the HKMAO was trying to ease concerns that the situation in the city would escalate further. When asked if Beijing had ever considered removing the chief executive, whose ill-advised legislative proposal to allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including the mainland triggered the political crisis, Yang said the central government would “resolutely” support Lam. He said Lam had already acknowledged there were shortcomings in her policies and promised to take steps to improve her governance. China watcher Johnny Lau Yui-siu said it suggested Beijing’s support for Lam was not unconditional and was based on practical needs. “Carrie Lam is facing increasing opposition from the pro-establishment camp, civil servants and even the police. Beijing has to back her at this moment,” Lau said. However, he noted that Beijing had distanced itself from the Hong Kong government’s decisions over the extradition bill. Yang sidestepped the question of setting up an independent inquiry into the police handling of the protests – one of the key demands of those constantly taking to the streets. He said the most pressing issue for the city now was to stop criminal and violent activities and restore law and order. Yang also lashed out at some foreign critics for making “irresponsible and “laughable” comments about Hong Kong. He warned China would not tolerate any foreign intervention. His comments drew mixed reactions. Opposition lawmakers from the pan-democratic camp decried it as another sign that Beijing had lost touch with the Hong Kong public and misunderstood the root causes of their grievances. “Everybody knows the core issue is a political problem. [If we] focus on chaos stemming from the political problem instead of addressing the problem itself, it is putting the cart in front of the horse,” said education-sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen. Legislator Raymond Chan Chi-chuen was worried that with Beijing’s support, police would become “even more relentless in their use of force”. Police Inspectors’ Association Chairman Wilkie Ng Wai-kei, on the other hand, described Yang’s comments as “truly supportive”. He said it showed Beijing’s appreciation of their hard work. Albert Lee Yiu-ting, spokesman for the Junior Police Officers’ Association, which represents 25,000 officers, also welcomed Yang’s vote of confidence. Lee warned that police would not tolerate violence against officers. Most mainland Chinese analysts described Yang’s comments as soft and moderate. “It shows Beijing is still patient and tolerant. It wants to win over the majority in Hong Kong by making a difference between peaceful demonstrations and unlawful protests and violence,” said Zhang Dinghuai, an expert on China’s Hong Kong policy at Shenzhen University. Li Huan, an expert at The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the central government saw the police force as the city’s “pillar of stability” and wanted to offer law enforcers some encouragement in their moment of crisis. “Hong Kong police and Hong Kong civil servants are the two keys to uphold the principle of ‘Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong’,” he said. “Some civil servants have already violated the principle of political neutrality [by joining the demonstration]. Police so far are carrying out their duty faithfully. They deserve support.” Tian Feilong, associate professor at Beihang University’s Law School in Beijing, said the central government was still hopeful that Hong Kong could resolve the crisis by itself. “Unless Hong Kong is totally out of control, the central government does not want to get involved,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3020554/beijing-tells-hong-kong-return-normality-most-pressing-priority
Hong Kong rail staff threaten to strike as MTR Corp battles to restore driver morale after Yuen Long station attack,Rail giant vows to review safety procedures after mob attacks passengers; Unions urge members not to strike as anger over treatment of female driver remains,"10:08pm, 29 Jul, 2019","The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China’s cabinet, struck a measured tone in responding for the first time to the escalating social unrest gripping the city since June, triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill.; When asked about the possibility of the People’s Liberation Army being called in, Yang would only say the basis for such a deployment was outlined in the Basic Law and Garrison Law.; He rubbished allegations of collusion between police, mainland officials and a group of gangsters who indiscriminately attacked protesters, commuters and journalists in the northern rural town of Yuen Long on July 21.","The MTR Corporation vowed to review its safety procedures on Monday as it faced the threat of imminent strike action, and battled to restore the morale of hundreds of drivers angry at its handling of the violence in a northern Hong Kong station. As political tensions against the extradition bill continued to escalate, the rail operator’s frontline staff expressed outrage at its handling of the passengers who were beaten last weekend in Yuen Long, and there were calls online for a strike by drivers starting at 7am on Tuesday. However, two railway unions denied any involvement in a possible strike, and one urged its members to refrain from doing so, and said it had no idea who was behind the move. Tam Kin-chiu, vice-chairman of the pro-government Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions, which represents 4,000 MTR workers in four unions, said its members would not take part in any strike action. “We call on our colleagues to stand fast at their posts, maintain the normal operation of the railways and continue to serve the public,” he said. Tam made the appeal after his group met senior management of the MTR Corp to express concerns over the violence at Yuen Long station on July 21. He said senior management had promised to review the procedures surrounding the safety of passengers and staff in the wake of the incident. To Kwong-yan, the MTR Corporation Staff Union chairman, said the union had not organised a strike, and had not heard from any members planning to take part in industrial action. The union has more than 400 members. “The company has been meeting its 3,000 drivers and other frontline staff to pacify their tensions over the past few days,” he said. “We don’t know who, if any, will join the strike but I hope it won’t impose any unreasonable punishment on them. We’ll also offer our members any assistance.” The threat of a strike came amid a mounting internal crisis, as hundreds of frontline staff expressed anger at the rail giant’s handling of the Yuen Long incident, and accused it of letting a female driver take the blame and bear the brunt of public outrage. The West Rail line’s station, which connects Hung Hom in Kowloon and Tuen Mun in the New Territories, descended into chaos when a group of about 100 men attacked passengers and passers-by with rods and rattan sticks. At around 11pm, the driver told passengers to get out of the train, a move which drew a public backlash as moments later a group of men in white T-shirts launched a vicious attack on travellers on the platforms, and inside the train carriage. After several attempts, the train finally closed its door and left the platform at 11.14pm. But the driver was criticised for ignoring passengers’ safety and leaving them vulnerable to the attack. The MTR Corp insisted the control centre in Tsing Yi, which gave instructions to the driver, was operating according to established protocol, and made decisions based on instant intelligence from staff on site. The violence also sparked outrage against the police, with officers not arriving on the scene until 35 minutes after the first emergency call was made. Since the incident, about 1,000 staff from different sections of the MTR, including drivers from the Tseung Kwan O line, West Rail line, Ma On Shan line, and frontline staff from Tsing Yi and Sunny Bay stations have written to the corporation’s management to express their dissatisfaction with the way the matter was handled. An MTR spokesman said the management had been meeting with staff to listen to their concerns and views on how to better deal with similar incidents in the future. As to the potential strike on Tuesday, he said the rail operator believed “the rail staff had the best interests of the public at heart, and were dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable and reliable service for passengers”. “We’ll closely monitor the situation and make adjustments accordingly. We call for our passengers to be understanding and pay attention to the station broadcast and listen to the instructions of our staff,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3020543/hong-kong-rail-staff-strike-threat-mtr-corp-battles
Hong Kong’s biggest broadcaster TVB warns employees against actions that would ‘impose one’s political inclination on work’,"Internal note from TVB chief Mark Lee comes after station’s headquarters adorned with banners criticising protest coverage; Banners had the phrases ‘instigating confrontations’, ‘suppressing voices’ and ‘destroying conscience’","6:46pm, 29 Jul, 2019","Mark Lee Po-on, the chief executive officer of Television Broadcasts (TVB), cautioned staff against displaying placards and banners criticising its news department at the firm’s headquarters in Tseung Kwan O, according to an email viewed by the Post.; He said those responsible for the banners were attempting to suppress and discredit TVB news. Lee added that the company fully supported press freedom.; TVB recently lost some advertisers, including Pocari Sweat, the Japanese sports drink, after internet users called for a boycott and accused the broadcaster of a pro-Beijing bias in their news coverage.; Last month, a TVB cameraman was harassed while covering a rally outside the justice minister’s office compound.; Lee said the company fully supported its news department in upholding editorial independence, objectivity and professionalism in its reports.","Hong Kong’s biggest television broadcaster on Monday warned its employees against allowing their political opinions to affect editorial decisions and lashed out at internal criticism of the company’s recent protest coverage. Lee was referring to four banners that appeared outside the offices on Sunday with the phrases “instigating confrontations”, “suppressing voices” and “destroying conscience”. Lee said in the email that he suspected individual TVB employees had placed the banners at the station and were “abetted by a few media organisations and competitors with the ulterior motive to suppress freedom of the press of TVB”. “Although individual staff may have different political stances, we will not allow any such behaviours inside the company which directly or indirectly interfere with the news department, or impose one’s political inclination on work,” he said. “The company will absolutely not tolerate such actions and will be resolute in pursuing the matter.” The internal warning at TVB is another aspect of the ongoing crisis created by the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions where the city has no handover agreement, including mainland China. A source familiar with TVB said the area where the banners were placed required staff cards for access. Another source said that several weeks ago detailed information about TVB crews’ locations, reporters on assignments and other editorial information had been posted on Telegram, an encrypted messaging platform. “Since the beginning of the demonstrations and protest actions in June, TVB has always maintained impartiality, fairness and accuracy in its news reports despite mounting pressure,” he said.

"Hong Kong police chief proud of how officers have handled extradition bill protests, and appeals for unity in face of ‘unparalleled challenges’","Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo writes to 30,000-strong force in bid to soothe anger and boost morale; Top cop tells officers he will stand by them and praises their ‘enormous contribution’ over past seven weeks","6:43pm, 29 Jul, 2019","Mark Lee Po-on, the chief executive officer of Television Broadcasts (TVB), cautioned staff against displaying placards and banners criticising its news department at the firm’s headquarters in Tseung Kwan O, according to an email viewed by the Post.; He said those responsible for the banners were attempting to suppress and discredit TVB news.

Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung’s letter to his officers was an attempt to soothe their anger and boost morale amid escalating confrontations with extradition bill protesters. The regular clashes since June 9 have also seen the relationship between police and the government sour, and a staff association had accused the city’s deputy leader of “writing off’ police efforts in an unexpected apology to society. “Officers’ enormous contribution in this regard is obvious in the eyes of the public, for which I am really proud,” Lo wrote in his letter, adding that he shared their pain and sorrow over any lawless behaviour, brutal attacks on officers, and groundless accusations of complicity in the violence in Yuen Long. “I, together with the force management, will always stand by you and do our utmost to overcome the challenges ahead, despite any adversities we face,” he wrote. While frontline officers said their belief in their duty had been shattered by Chief Secretary Matthew Chung Kin-chung’s recent public apology for the force’s handling of the violent attacks at Yuen Long MTR station, Lo appealed for their persistence in safeguarding the rule of law in Hong Kong. “I urge all of you to stay united in this testing period, and remain committed to our sworn duties to fight for our home,” Lo said. Officers handling the mass extradition bill protests that have rocked the city for the past seven weeks have seen peaceful marches often descend into violent clashes with demonstrators. Police have used tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, sponge grenades, and pepper spray to try and disperse protesters who have occupied roads and disrupted travel in the city. Both sides have suffered injuries in protests linked to the controversial legislation that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions Hong Kong lacked an agreement with, including mainland China. Lo said the protests had posed “an unparalleled challenge to the force”, adding he knew that his officers had to work long hours and were subjected to fierce physical and verbal attacks by protesters. “In the last weekend, many of you needed to wear a gas mask for a long time while operating on the ground in hot and humid weather,” the letter continued. “Your exceptional level of professionalism and courage displayed successfully restored public order without causing a large amount of casualties.” In response to the message, chairman of the Police Inspectors’ Association Wilkie Ng Wai-kei said this showed Lo fully appreciated the hard work by officers. “Hong Kong relies on its police officers for safety,” Ng said. Police staff associations were up in arms last week after Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung’s apology, and accused the government of making them question their duty. The Junior Police Officers’ Association, which has 25,000 members, challenged Cheung to try taking charge of operations for the unrest in Yuen Long that day, and to consider stepping down. Lo will meet Cheung, and the four associations, on Tuesday. Separately, police on Monday brushed off rumours that an officer from the Special Tactical Squad had modified a baton by adding a metal ring to its end, while using it to disperse the crowd in Yuen Long. In a statement, police said the officer involved was using a baton with plastic straps encircling its end, where a rope was attached. “The rope was pulled out while being used, and the plastic straps then slipped to the front part of the baton, and caused a misunderstanding,” the statement read. But concern group Civil Rights Observer said it was not convinced, adding that the baton in the picture displayed by police was different from the one in the image circulating online. The group added it would file a complaint against police.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020513/hong-kong-police-chief-proud-how-officers-have-handled
Chinese state media calls for ‘forceful’ police action to end Hong Kong unrest,People’s Daily publishes strong commentary hours before first announcement from Beijing on city crisis; It followed weekend of violent protests which saw police using tear gas and rubber bullets,"1:40pm, 29 Jul, 2019",The commentary also came just hours before the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office was set to hold a press conference in Beijing to outline “its stance and views on Hong Kong’s current situation”. The South China Morning Post will carry live coverage of the press conference from 3pm.,"Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily has called on the Hong Kong police to take immediate and forceful action to end the unrest and restore law and order in the city, in a strongly worded commentary published on Monday. “At a time like this, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and the police should not hesitate or have any unnecessary ‘psychological worries’ about taking all necessary steps [to restore order],” the commentary said. “The SAR government and police should not forget that their strongest backing comes from the sacred missions bestowed on them by the Basic Law and the law of Hong Kong, and hence the SAR government and the police must act now in accordance with the laws, and punish all those perpetrators of violence as prescribed by the law. “We cannot condone the lawbreakers just because they are holding up high the banner of ‘freedom and democracy’ or wearing the hat of ‘civil disobedience’.” The commentary followed a weekend of violent protests in Yuen Long and Hong Kong’s Central district which saw the city’s police using tear gas and rubber bullets outside the central government’s liaison office in one of the bloodiest clashes with anti-government protesters since June. The protesters have demanded a complete withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill – which would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to other jurisdictions, including mainland China – and the establishment of an independent inquiry into the police’s handing of the protests. Although China’s state media has published editorials and commentaries critical of the protests in Hong Kong in the past month, Monday’s People’s Daily commentary clearly stated that the city government and police could not continue their “conciliatory” approach and hold back in their actions for worries over “political backfiring”. “Putting an end to and punishing unlawful behaviours is a priority task of Hong Kong police,” the commentary said. “Because of political reasons, [the police] have been hesitant to act, and this is not a normal situation. “As such, Hong Kong has lost its normal way of life as a society governed by the rule of law, and fallen into the ‘trap’ of foreign forces who are determined to sow unrest in China in the name of ‘democracy’,” it added. The article repeated Beijing’s assertion that the anti-government protests in Hong Kong were instigated by Western forces, backing the claim by quoting statements from the US State Department on respecting the “freedom of speech and assembly” by the protesters. The commentary also cited the British government suspension of exports of anti-riot gear to Hong Kong as further evidence of interference by foreign powers into Hong Kong’s affairs. The article reiterated that without social stability, there could be no democracy in Hong Kong. “Rule of law is a core value of Hong Kong, and a prerequisite for democracy,” the commentary said. “If the rule of law is violated, and the society becomes unstable, then how can we talk about democracy?” Also on Monday, People’s Daily published a commentary by Su Xiaohui, from a Chinese foreign ministry think tank, condemning the pro-democracy Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) for calling on foreign governments to issue travel alerts on Hong Kong. “This move has exposed the pro-independence nature of the CHRF … And recently, CHRF has planned and organised extremely violent acts under the pretext of the extradition bill, severely undermined the rule of law in Hong Kong, and jeopardised Hong Kong’s safety, stability, law and order, and damaged the city’s image,” Su said. Su, a deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies’ Department of International and Strategic Studies, also said tourism was one of Hong Kong’s traditional pillar industries. “Once the brand is damaged, it will be very difficult to restore.” Henry Chan, senior visiting research fellow at the Cambodia Institute for Cooperation and Peace, said People’s Daily had sent an important message in support of the Hong Kong police, who have faced widespread criticism for failing to protect ordinary citizens. “Beijing knows that, under ‘one country, two systems’, the Hong Kong police is the only institution that can prevent Hong Kong from falling into anarchy,” Chan said. “I believe this message would be reinforced in this afternoon’s HKMAO’s presser,” he added. The press conference will be the first time the HKMAO has held a press briefing on the city since the 1997 handover. It also suggests the Chinese leadership may have reached a decision on ending the wave of mass protests in Hong Kong.

Anti-riot vehicles equipped with water cannons to begin road tests in Hong Kong and could be ready to disperse protesters in August,"Designed for crowd control and costing more than US$2 million, the Mercedes-Benz vehicles have been stationed in Fanling since May; Force considering spraying liquid dye at radical protesters to make identifying suspects easier, senior police source reveals","8:00am, 29 Jul, 2019","Peaceful protests against the now-shelved bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions Hong Kong lacked an agreement with including mainland China, have often descended into violent clashes with police.","Three controversial anti-riot vehicles armed with water cannons will hit the streets of Hong Kong this week and be ready to handle unrest by mid-August if they pass road tests, the Post has learned. Operational guidelines had been finalised and the force was weighing up whether to use the vehicles to spray liquid dye on radical protesters to make identifying suspects easier, a senior police insider revealed. Designed for crowd control and costing a total of HK$16.59 million (US$2.12 million), the Mercedes-Benz vehicles arrived in the city in May last year and have since been stationed at the Police Tactical Unit headquarters in Fanling for training. While some top brass want to deploy the new alternative “as soon as possible” in light of escalating violence in recent protests, the armoured cars still need to pass road tests as requested, the insider said. “A test has been scheduled. We will drive the vehicles onto the streets later this week and test them for several days,” the source said. “The whole process and examination will take more than a week. If everything goes well, the specialised crowd-management vehicles can be deployed at large-scale assemblies from mid-August at the earliest.” The insider added the vehicles would provide an alternative way of dispersing radical charging crowds, and create a safe distance between protesters and officers, minimising the possibility of physical confrontation and the risk of injury to those at the scene. “Tear gas has not always dispersed crowds effectively at recent mass demonstrations. Protesters still attack us with bricks and metal rods. They even threw petrol bombs or our own tear gas canisters back at us over a very short distance,” the source said. “If the situation and location allow, these vehicles are a better option to reclaim ground.” According to operational guidelines, the use of the vehicles would only be considered if there was a serious injury, loss of life, widespread destruction of property or disruption of traffic by occupation of major thoroughfares resulting in significant consequences for public order or safety. Human rights groups and some legislators have raised concerns over the potentially fatal water cannons. A South Korean farmer was seriously injured during a protest in 2015 when a police water cannon knocked him off his feet, causing him to smash his head on the road. He later died. In a study by a local police monitoring group in 2015, Civil Rights Observer said jets of water could hit with 145kg of force from a distance of five metres and 127kg at 10 metres. The assistant commissioner of police overseeing operations could authorise the vehicles’ deployment following a threat assessment. The guidelines also stated any use should be in line with the Police General Order governing the use of force by officers. The French custom-built vehicles each boast 15 high-pressure cannons. Tender documents show two cannons on the roof can fire more than 1,200 litres of water a minute over a distance of 50 metres. The water can be mixed with tear gas or liquid dye that would allow police to identify the main protagonists after they are dispersed. The source said the colour spray was not a weapon but a tool to gather evidence. Six cameras are installed on each vehicle. “Those at the forefront charging at us could be sprayed with paint. The paint is hard to remove, so it is useful for us to identify who charged us,” he said. “But at this stage, we are still discussing whether it is an option.” The force has repeatedly stressed over the past few weeks that officers were still being trained to use the vehicles, when asked whether water cannons would be deployed to handle mass extradition bill protests that have rocked Hong Kong since June 9. Officers have used tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, sponge grenades and pepper spray to try and disperse radical protesters occupying roads overnight, with mixed results. A police spokesman often responded to the question of using the water cannons by saying the force did not see the need to deploy the vehicles if the protests were peaceful. Police proposed buying the cannons in the government’s annual budget announced in February 2015, two months after the 79-day Occupy protests ended.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020397/anti-riot-vehicles-equipped-water-cannons-begin-road

The rally – scheduled for Friday at Chater Garden in Central – was expected to draw 500 to 1,000 government workers. It was announced after a number of administrative officers, executive officers and government lawyers separately issued letters urging Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to order an independent inquiry into the fiasco. “Many of our colleagues have expressed their concerns online over the situation and we think it is time to provide everyone a platform, and to unite our demands to the chief executive and her governing team,” said Michael Ngan Mo-chau, who works in the Labour Department and is one of the rally organisers. “We would like to play our parts in help to mend the widening rift in society by channelling the citizens’ voices to the administration.” Ngan said the group hoped Lam would address the five demands made by protesters, including to fully withdraw the now-suspended extradition bill and order an investigation into the police’s use of force in handling the anti-bill protests. Cheung Ka-po, a rally organiser from the Transport Department, said a dozen civil servants had started a group on Telegram, an online platform, and decided to hold a rally after hundreds of their colleagues put forth anonymous petitions last week. “Some have thought of planning a strike but it is not easy to implement and would also affect citizens,” Cheung said. “As civil servants, we hope to tell the chief executive that there are people on her own team who want her to address the protesters’ demands.” Cheung said he hoped the peaceful rally would help cool down the tense social climate. Leaders of the civil servants’ group said they would apply for a letter of no objection from the police on Monday. Anti-government protesters and police clashed at multiple spots this weekend, including Yuen Long and Sai Ying Pun where rubber bullets and tear gas were fired. Ngan and Cheung said they were not worried about possible retaliation. “The rally would only be held after office hours,” said Cheung. “We are also Hongkongers after getting off work.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020414/hong-kong-government-faces-another-challenge-civil-servants
Beijing to respond to social unrest in Hong Kong after more violent clashes following protest rally,Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office will give its stance and views on the situation – the first time it has held a press briefing on city since the handover; Announcement comes as some of Hong Kong Island’s busiest districts again become a battleground between protesters and riot police,"12:37am, 29 Jul, 2019","It will be the first time the HKMAO has held a press briefing on the city since Britain handed it over to China in 1997. It also suggests the Chinese leadership may have reached a decision on Hong Kong since a wave of mass protests and violent clashes over a now-shelved extradition bill began nearly two months ago.; Beijing strongly condemned protesters who defaced the national emblem and spray-painted anti-Chinese slogans on the liaison office building in Sai Ying Pun a week ago, and public sentiment on the mainland towards Hong Kong has become noticeably more negative since.; The clashes followed another violent, illegal protest in the northern town of Yuen Long on Saturday. Police arrested 13 people on Sunday morning for their parts in the Yuen Long protest, including organiser Max Chung Kin-ping.","China’s top Hong Kong policy office will on Monday respond for the first time to escalating civil unrest that has beset the city’s government since June. The announcement came as anti-government protesters clashed with riot police outside the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong for a second consecutive weekend. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China’s cabinet, will hold a press conference in Beijing to give “its stance and views on Hong Kong’s current situation”, according to a central government notice. The proposed legislation would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including mainland China, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial. The liaison office also stepped up security afterwards and installed a protective plastic screen in front of the emblem. On Sunday, a clash outside the liaison office – the symbol of Beijing’s presence in the city – was more muted than the scenes of last weekend, with riot police putting up a line of defence about 200 metres (660 feet) from the building and stopping protesters from marching towards it. As night fell, officers again unfurled black banners warning that they would use force, firing tear gas at protesters just before 7pm in an attempt to disperse them. The protesters held their line behind a wall of umbrellas and threw projectiles at the officers. Gradually, the riot police gained ground and pushed protesters further away from the liaison office, but the crowd did not disperse until well into the night. For hours, the two sides clashed along Connaught Road and Des Voeux Road – the two main thoroughfares in the central and western area of Hong Kong Island. The protesters threw bricks, paint bombs and bottles at police, who responded with tear gas and beanbag rounds. Some protesters set fire to a trolley loaded with cardboard and shoved it towards officers. Others were seen carrying weapons like bows and arrows. Police subdued and arrested at least a dozen protesters. As of 12.30am on Monday, 16 injured people had been sent to Queen Mary Hospital, the Hospital Authority said. Four had been discharged and the other 12 were still hospitalised in stable condition. As of 2am, at least 49 people had been arrested for participating in unauthorised assemblies and possession of offensive weapons. Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan said police strongly condemn the “escalating” violence of some radical protesters, including setting fires and throwing large road signs and heavy items from a flyover at officers on the ground. She did not release the number of tear gas rounds, rubber bullets and sponge grenades that police had used in Sheung Wan and the Western district on Sunday. As was the case a day ago, Yu could not give information on why a police baton used by an officer during clashes with protesters in Yuen Long MTR station on Saturday had a ring-like object near its tip. Concerns have been raised by critics who said the attachment could cause serious injury to protesters. The demonstrators had defied a police ban to march to the liaison office, one of several protests that sprang from a rally at Chater Garden in Central earlier in the day. At one point, spontaneous protests broke out along main roads on Hong Kong Island, stretching more than 6km (3.7 miles) and running through the city’s financial district Central and shopping area Causeway Bay. Police approved the Chater Garden rally earlier this week but rejected the application for the march to Sai Ying Pun. But tens of thousands of people ignored the ban and splintered off in different directions soon after the rally in Central began around 3pm. Shortly after midnight, a government spokesman said, “We strongly condemn the radical protesters who disregarded the law and order and violently breached the public peace. “We will continue to give full support to the police to strictly enforce the law to stop all violent behaviours with a view to resuming public order as soon as possible.” “He insisted on going to Yuen Long … which ended in a series of violent acts. Police will never condone this behaviour,” a police spokeswoman said, adding that officers had confiscated weapons including imitation firearms and metal rods. The warning had little effect on those at Chater Garden on Sunday, many of whom had also joined the previous day’s demonstration. “I don’t think people will have protest fatigue, even though many of them marched for the whole day yesterday. I, for one, am in for the long haul,” said Ho Yi-lik, a Yuen Long resident who was at both rallies. The chaotic protests brought traffic in one of the world’s busiest districts to a standstill. Dozens of bus services had to be diverted and many shops closed. But during another day of chaos in Hong Kong, the city’s top officials – including Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor – spent Sunday at a youth summer camp at the People’s Liberation Army barracks in rural district Fanling. In the city centre, protesters vowed they would not stop unless their demands were met. Third-year university student Aaron Yam, 20, said a key demand was to launch an “independent and fair inquiry” into police handling of the demonstrations. “The only way out for Hong Kong is to have a fair inquiry into the policing of recent protests,” he said. Meanwhile, a group of civil servants from various government departments issued a statement saying they would organise a rally to support the protesters on Friday, estimating about 500 people would take part. It will be the first time a group of civil servants has joined the anti-government protests. All eyes will now be on Beijing, but several mainland observers said the central government was unlikely to announce any measure that could resolve the crisis during its briefing. “It’s likely the officials will reprimand advocates of Hong Kong independence … as well as express support for the Hong Kong government and its police force,” said Zhang Dinghuai, a Hong Kong policy researcher with Shenzhen University. But analysts expected major policy adjustments were likely to be taking place behind the scenes.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020416/beijing-respond-social-unrest-hong-kong-after-more-violent
"Hong Kong protesters use ‘guerilla tactics’, clashing with police and unleashing more chaos – all the way from Sai Wan to Causeway Bay","March at times appears directionless, but protesters say splitting the main body was trick to deplete police resources; Protest movement appears to change targets – from the hated extradition bill to the Hong Kong government","11:07pm, 28 Jul, 2019","It will be the first time the HKMAO has held a press briefing on the city since Britain handed it over to China in 1997. It also suggests the Chinese leadership may have reached a decision on Hong Kong since a wave of mass protests and violent clashes over a now-shelved extradition bill began nearly two months ago.; Beijing strongly condemned protesters who defaced the national emblem and spray-painted anti-Chinese slogans on the liaison office building in Sai Ying Pun a week ago, and public sentiment on the mainland towards Hong Kong has become noticeably more negative since.; The clashes followed another violent, illegal protest in the northern town of Yuen Long on Saturday. Police arrested 13 people on Sunday morning for their parts in the Yuen Long protest, including organiser Max Chung Kin-ping.","Hong Kong’s young protesters changed tactics on Sunday as they turned a rally in Central into a 6km multipronged march all the way from Sai Wan to Causeway Bay. Tens of thousands of protesters on Sunday defied a police ban for the second consecutive day and occupied major thoroughfares on Hong Kong Island. A day earlier, an estimated 280,000 Hongkongers joined a march in Yuen Long that ended in violence, tear gas and more chaos. The police had earlier turned down a request to hold a march from Central to Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park in Sai Ying Pun over fears of violence. Instead, the authorities allowed protesters to hold a rally at Chater Garden in Central. Soon after the rally started at 3pm, however, thousands left the authorised zone, spilled out onto Chater Road and advanced towards Admiralty along Queensway with no clear destination. Some protest leaders suggested marching to North Point, but the marchers – at about 4.30pm – stopped at Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong’s most popular shopping districts, where they began erecting barricades by dismantling metal railings. Around the same time, a group of protesters in the middle of the march decided to head west to Sai Ying Pun to rally at Beijing’s liaison office in the city. The liaison office was attacked a week before, on July 21, by protesters who pelted the building with eggs and paintballs and defaced China’s national emblem. This time the liaison office was ready: hours earlier, staff had protected the newly replaced national emblem with what appeared to be Plexiglas. Several protesters told the Post that the new tactic of splitting the main body of protesters into different groups was a way to drain the energy and resources of police. “In the past, we have always concentrated on one destination, but it’s almost like guerilla tactics this time,” said 28-year-old Willie Wong. Chloe Chan, 22, who marched towards Admiralty with two friends, said police were to blame for the paralysed roads. “It was police who forced us to go in different directions because they had not approved a specific route for the march in the first place,” she said. The freestyle march also appeared to give protesters choices about how they wanted to participate. In Central, a protester held a placard written with three options: head towards the Causeway Bay, where police officers were clearing the roads; Sai Ying Pun, where there was a heavy police presence; or Chater Garden, where they would be free from any legal consequences because it was a lawful rally. At one location, a 450-metre human chain was formed by protesters to pass helmets, umbrellas, cling wrap and other items. Some protesters served as runners to take urgently needed supplies to the frontline. At around 6pm, organisers urged protesters to stop passing supplies to the east and called on them to shift the resources to Sai Ying Pun, where a stand-off was under way with riot police some 200 metres from the liaison office. “Our main purpose today is to demand that police explain the 36 shots they fired in Sheung Wan on July 21. There’s no use going to Causeway Bay,” said Colour Chan, 24, who was worried about police operations later in Sai Wan, “We need more people there to protect our protesters,” she said. A 26-year old protester, who gave her surname as Yeung, said numbers mattered for the guerilla strategy to work. “If there are enough people, it might be a good idea to distract the police with diverged groups. But if we do not have enough people, it’s better for us to concentrate and stay together,” she said. Some younger protesters bought stacks of single-trip tickets and handed them out at Causeway Bay MTR station to those heading to Sai Ying Pun. Another team of protesters provided single-trip tickets at Sheung Wan station for people who planned to head back to the eastern New Territories. Demonstrators had been using single-trip tickets instead of their Octopus cards on protest days to avoid being tracked down by police. The protest movement, which started in June by denouncing the now-shelved extradition bill, seems to have transformed into a drive against the Hong Kong government – and even the city’s constitutional system. The most frequent chant in the crowd on Sunday was “Liberate Hong Kong: the revolution of our times”. The slogan was the election campaign tagline of Edward Leung, a pro-independence activist who was jailed for his role in the 2016 Mong Kok riot.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020412/hong-kong-protesters-use-guerilla-tactics-clashing-police
Hong Kong protests: police under fire as viral video shows elderly residents of Yuen Long care home suffering from effects of tear gas,Footage filmed from inside Kwan Yue Elder Nursing Home on On Lok Road; Woman can be heard on video asking why windows aren’t closed as police fire gas at protesters outside,"6:06pm, 28 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong police’s decision to fire tear gas in the heavily populated and residential district of Yuen Long on Saturday has come under fire, after a viral video showed residents of an old people’s home choking on the noxious substance.","The footage shows a cloud of tear gas spreading inside the room through a window, which is soon completely blocked from view. It contradicts the police’s earlier claim that no nursing homes had been affected by their clearance operation. Sounds of coughing can be heard on the video, with an old lady saying: “Why aren’t the windows closed?” The woman is believed to be a resident on the first floor of the Kwan Yue Elder Nursing Home in Yuen Long. The building faces On Lok Road, where tear gas was fired by riot police against protesters. On Sunday, a staff member from the nursing home said no residents had been sent to hospital because of the tear gas. He said police had called them in advance to take precautionary measures against possible chaos. An estimated hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers had defied a police ban on Saturday to march in the northern town to protest the brutal violence in Yuen Long MTR station last week, where a mob indiscriminately attacked passengers and protesters returning from a march against the extradition bill. On Saturday afternoon, protesters advanced along On Lok Road with their umbrellas up as they hurled objects at the police, who used tear gas, sponge grenades, pepper spray and batons to drive them back at multiple spots. Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan had earlier said no elderly care homes had been affected, and said the force had called 22 of them nearby on Saturday. Staff from two other nursing homes confirmed they had received such calls, and added they were not affected with the windows closed. Yuen Long was largely back to normal on Sunday morning, as businesses reopened and shoppers returned to the streets. Chinese pastry store Hang Heung bakery, which is famous for its “wife cakes”, said business on Saturday had been better than usual. Some protesters had tried to get around the banned march by saying they were only going to Yuen Long for the store’s traditional pastries. “All the products were sold out, so we had to close earlier in the evening,” a staff member said. But along On Lok Road, which was closer to the clashes, small businesses suffered from a drop in profits. Apple Wong, a manager of a cafe, said the restaurant had closed earlier than normal as the protest broke out. “We usually earn between HK$5,000 and HK$6,000 a day, but we only had around $1,000 yesterday,” she said. Traces of the protest could be found throughout the northern town, with graffiti of the slogan “liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times” spray-painted on the walls of bridges and alleyways. The phrase was the election slogan of pro-independence activist Edward Leung Tin-kei in 2016, who was subsequently barred from legislature elections and jailed for six years for his role in the Mong Kok riot, which took place in the same year. Metal railings along On Lok Road had gone missing after protesters removed them to form barricades, while certain parts of the ground had been dug up, and bricks were missing. Some residents recounted their experiences of Saturday’s chaos. Cheryl Yuen, a resident living in a building on Tai Cheung Street, said she had stayed at home for the whole day, but could smell the tear gas even in her home on the 11th floor. “We could smell the gas and it was irritating our eyes. We immediately closed the windows and turned on the air con,” she said. A 35-year-old resident, who only gave her name as Mable, said she was stung by tear gas when she went to buy food on Saturday. “From where I was standing, I did not notice the police putting up warnings,” she said. Joyce Leung, a resident who lives on Shui Che Kwun Lane, said the impact of tear gas was limited as she thought all staff of the nursing homes nearby had prepared well and closed all the windows in advance. But Cyrus Wong Ka-ho, who owns an interior design business on the same lane, criticised the police’s arrangement. “It was not necessary to use tear gas and deploy the riot police,” the 30-year-old said. “Most protesters were peaceful and polite at first and the area is close to residential area and elderly homes after all.” Lawmaker Claudia Mo Man-ching, convenor of the pro-democracy camp, agreed as she lashed out at the decision to fire tear gas in crowded neighbourhoods where nursing homes are located. “The aggressiveness of the police force has become almost out of control and unchecked,” she said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020393/hong-kong-protests-police-under-fire-viral-video-shows

Key figure behind Yuen Long march Max Chung arrested for ‘organising unlawful assembly’ after hundreds of thousands join protest banned by Hong Kong police,Yuen Long resident Chung taken away by police after he attends forum at Victoria Park; Chung proposed march after bloody attacks at Yuen Long MTR station last Sunday when more than 100 men attacked protesters and passers-by,"3:04pm, 28 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong police’s decision to fire tear gas in the heavily populated and residential district of Yuen Long on Saturday has come under fire, after a viral video showed residents of an old people’s home choking on the noxious substance.","Police have arrested a proponent of Saturday’s march in Hong Kong for organising an unlawful assembly, which hundreds of thousands of protesters were estimated to have joined despite it being banned by the force. Max Chung Kin-ping, 39, was among the 14 people the police have so far arrested for the protest in Yuen Long. The others were arrested unauthorised assembly, possession of offensive weapons and common assault. Chung was taken away by police after he attended an RTHK forum at Victoria Park, according to Michael Mo Kwan-tai, the march co-applicant. After losing an appeal on Friday against the police objection to the march in Yuen Long, Chung said he would still go ahead alone and would not ask people to follow him. But he added at the time: “Of course, if some people want to buy sweetheart cakes or do something else such as taking a walking in Yuen Long, as a Yuen Long resident, I absolutely welcome [them].” And at a press briefing on Saturday night, Chung denied the protest was a march. “First, I want to clarify that today is not a march. We are all individuals, so I haven’t told anyone to do anything,” he said. Chung proposed the march after bloody attacks at Yuen Long MTR station last Sunday when more than 100 white-clad men attacked protesters in black T-shirts, other passengers and journalists. At least 45 people were injured. But Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan of Police Public Relations Bureau said on Sunday afternoon: “[Chung] insisted on going to Yuen Long … ending in a series of violent acts. The police will never condone these behaviour.” Yu said the force had confiscated weapons, including imitation firearms and metal rods, at the protest. She confirmed at least 14 people had been arrested in connection with the Saturday’s protest in Yuen Long, and that Chung was arrested on Sunday for organising an unapproved march and assembly after receiving a letter of objection from the police. Chung estimated 288,000 people marched the route he proposed. The police did not give a figure, saying it was an illegal assembly. The march ended in clashes between the protesters and police when officers tried to disperse the crowds from occupied roads in Yuen Long with tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades. The last round of clashes broke out inside Yuen Long MTR station after 10pm when officers hit protesters with batons and fired pepper spray, after demonstrators threw fire extinguishers from a bridge. At least 23 people were injured in the clashes throughout the day. Chung had said earlier that he advocated a “peaceful, rational and non-violent” protest, but could not give a guarantee. In Hong Kong, public assemblies are governed by the Public Order Ordinance. An assembly can only be held if the police do not prohibit or object to it – otherwise it will be considered an unauthorised assembly. Participants and organisers found are liable to imprisonment for five years on conviction on indictment and a HK$5,000 fine and imprisonment for three years on summary conviction. Barrister Albert Luk Wai-hung said there would be one key factor in determining if Chung had organised or taken part in an unlawful march and assembly. “If he was only there shopping around, it should be no problem,” said Luk, “If he had been there meeting other protesters or discussing with them what they should do, that is another story.” Luk said the police might have collected some evidence. Lawmaker James To Kun-sun, of the opposition Democratic Party, who is also a lawyer, criticised the police for abusing their power, pointing out that Chung, who was walking alone in Yuen Long, could just be shopping there. “How could he have the power to stop others from going to Yuen Long?” said To. “Basically, there was no march in Yuen Long.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020384/key-figure-behind-yuen-long-march-max-chung-arrested
Hong Kong police adopt new tactics to make protesters leave illegal Yuen Long march in bid to avoid bloody battle in town rocked by mob violence,Officers call up additional trains to avoid repeat of clashes in Sha Tin but violence still flares inside station; Protesters given time to leave from Long Ping and Yuen Long MTR stations after tensions ease between two sides,"8:00am, 28 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong police’s decision to fire tear gas in the heavily populated and residential district of Yuen Long on Saturday has come under fire, after a viral video showed residents of an old people’s home choking on the noxious substance.","Hong Kong police on Saturday ordered additional train services and gave protesters time to leave Yuen Long – a new tactic to avoid a repeat of bloody confrontations at a Sha Tin shopping centre two weeks ago. About 90 minutes after tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside Nam Pin Wai village, removing fences from roads, vandalising police vehicles and attacking officers with bricks, umbrellas and iron poles, the force ordered a dispersal operation at 5pm and fired the first round of tear gas, followed by many more rounds and sponge grenades. The tension and confrontation between protesters and police initially eased at around 6.30pm with officers pushing their cordon lines back. Protesters even negotiated with riot police, asking them not to block roads to the railway stations or trap them in shopping centres. Despite the new tactics, violence flared as officers ran inside Yuen Long station and hit protesters with their batons. Multiple rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge rounds were also fired earlier in the day. The chaotic scenes were broadcast live around the world, drawing an angry response from human rights activists. As of 1am on Sunday, 23 people had been injured, with two in serious condition. Police also arrested 11 people. Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan of the Police Public Relations explained why officers from the elite Special Tactical Squad had entered the station. “Protesters were throwing fire extinguishers from the bridge of the West Rail line at officers on the ground. We entered the station and got the scene under control,” she said. But she admitted the force had been unable to notify the MTR in advance as events unfolded so quickly. A senior police officer with knowledge of the operation, asked whether the force planned to wait for the crowds to disperse themselves at midnight, said: “Not exactly. But some protesters were leaving. We halted the operation for a short while to give people time to leave from Long Ping and Yuen Long stations on West Rail line. “Then our operation continued. We didn’t want to give protesters the chance to accuse us of trapping them, as in Sha Tin two weeks ago.” Police officers who tried to clear extradition bill protesters from Sha Tin’s New Town Plaza on July 14 were surrounded and assaulted by groups of youths in masks and helmets. Demonstrators were beaten and pepper sprayed in scenes of chaos, with families also getting caught up in the violence. Protesters had tried to leave via the MTR, through New Town Plaza, but were blocked by police. As the trouble erupted, passengers on an MTR train in Sha Tin station would not allow it to leave to allow as many protesters to board as possible, fearing it would be the last one of the night and there would be no escape. It prompted the MTR to stop service at Sha Tin station. Shortly before 7.30pm on Saturday, the railway giant announced a special train service on the West Rail line with empty trains departing Long Ping every 10 minutes. Other trains did not stop at Long Ping station. Police also appealed to members of public to leave eastward towards Yuen Long MTR station as the dispersal operation continued. “Violent clashes broke out at various locations in Yuen Long as some protesters removed fences from the kerbside and used metal barriers to block roads. Some hurled bricks and hard objects at police officers and charged cordon lines,” the police statement read. “To prevent further deterioration of the situation, police appeal to members of the public to leave in the eastern direction, towards Yuen Long MTR station and to avoid travelling in the Yuen Long area.” MTR Corp did not release details about the number of additional trains arranged. The source also explained why officers had not arrested protesters at the scene, since they were engaged in an unlawful assembly. “It often causes a scene and sparks even more attacks by protesters if we arrest someone on the spot. But we collected necessary evidence for further investigation,” he said. Police are yet to reveal the number of arrests. Relations between police and government soured on the eve of the protest as Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung publicly apologised for the force’s failure to stop a violent mob rampage in the northern town last Sunday. Stunned police associations were outraged as they had not been consulted in advance about the unexpected apology, which they themselves had refused to make, and top brass sought an urgent meeting with Cheung. Lam Chi-wai, chairman of Junior Police Officers’ Association which represents 25,000 police officers, said Cheung’s remark had badly damaged morale, but they would not let his words affect their performance in Yuen Long.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020364/hong-kong-police-help-protesters-leave-illegal-yuen
MTR releases details of Hong Kong station violence as it attempts to quell driver discontent over handling of issue,"About 1,000 staff members express anger at treatment of driver who told passengers to get off train; Rail operator acts after activists target employee’s family for abuse online","7:00am, 28 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong police’s decision to fire tear gas in the heavily populated and residential district of Yuen Long on Saturday has come under fire, after a viral video showed residents of an old people’s home choking on the noxious substance.","The MTR Corporation has attempted to pacify hundreds of frontline staff who had accused the rail operator of letting a female driver take the blame over its handling of the unprecedented violence at a Hong Kong district station last weekend. In a mounting internal crisis, the government-controlled firm released a series of photographs taken from security footage in an attempt to answer some of the criticism it received from about 1,000 employees, who said management had placed the blame for the July 21 incident in Yuen Long with the driver. The driver had told passengers to get out of the train, moments before a group of men in white T-shirts launched a vicious attack on travellers on the platforms and inside the train carriage. Online users retaliated by abusing her and her family on the internet. But, the MTR Corp said video footage showed that when passengers were told to leave the train, there were no violence on the platform. In a statement on Saturday night, the corporation said the four staff at the station at that time, which was about 10.45pm last Sunday, and the control centre in Tsing Yi, were operating according to established protocol, and made decisions based on instant intelligence from staff on site. “Unfortunately, they were criticised and even attacked personally after the incident,” the rail operator said. “The corporation strongly regrets what the staff members had to face.” The Yuen Long station of the West Rail line, which connects Hung Hom in Kowloon and Tuen Mun in the New Territories, descended into chaos when a group of about 100 men attacked whoever they saw in the station with rods and rattan sticks. The incident left at least 45 people injured, and 12 suspects have subsequently been arrested. The attackers mainly targeted protesters returning from an anti-extradition bill march in the city, but also beat other passengers, and even passers-by. The violence also sparked outrage against the police, with officers not arriving on the scene until 35 minutes after the first emergency call was made. The MTR Corp said it had never experienced a similar incident since it was founded 40 years ago. Protesters have blamed the rail operator for failing to protect passengers, and over the past week disrupted rush hour services in Hong Kong at key stations. Since the incident, different sections of employees from within the MTR, including drivers from the Tseung Kwan O line, West Rail line, Ma On Shan line, and frontline staff from Tsing Yi and Sunny Bay stations have written to the corporation’s management to express their dissatisfaction with the way the matter was handled. Tam Kin-chiu, the chairman of Hong Kong Railway Employees Union, estimated the number of staff behind the complaint amounted to about 1,000. The corporation has about 3,000 drivers, and a total payroll of about 18,000 in Hong Kong. “The management has taken turns to meet staff in the past few days to put out the fire,” he said. “It could have done better in terms of communication with staff and the union.” While declining to comment on videos and audio recordings, such as those centring on conversations between the driver and the control centre, the rail operator has released a timeline of what it calls several key events of that night. It said at about 10.55pm on July 21, a Tuen Mun-bound train arrived at the Yuen Long station, with passengers alighting and boarding as usual. The train driver however found some passengers had blocked carriage doors, but there were no attack on the platform. At 10.57pm, the operations control centre arranged for station staff to help close the carriage door, but they could not. At 10.59pm, or after the train could not shut its door for four minutes, the control centre told the driver to remove passengers and arrange for another train to pick up them up, an order based on company procedures. In a contradiction to what passengers said, the MTR Corp said at the time passengers were told to disembark, there was no attack taking place on the platform. But, just seven minutes later, the MTR Corp’s own security footage showed a large number of people moved to the platform from the concourse and fled into train compartment. A minute later, passengers told the driver an attack had taken place. As the carriage doors remained obstructed, the train was unable to depart. After several attempts, the doors of the train were closed at 11.13pm and the train departed a minute later. The train was stuck at the station for 19 minutes. Despite the management’s explanation, a group of 25 employees from Tsing Yi and Sunny Bay stations said it left much to be desired. They continued to press the management to meet their demands, which included disclosing all the details of the incident, vindicating all parties concerned, improving the company’s public image, reviewing internal protocol, and pressing police to protect the safety of passengers and staff.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3020371/mtr-releases-details-hong-kong-station-violence-it
"Another weekend in Hong Kong: chaos, tear gas and anger as protesters descend on Yuen Long","Tens of thousands march through the northern town where an armed mob attacked anti-government demonstrators a week ago; Tensions flared by late afternoon, and by nightfall a few hundred were still battling police at the train station","11:47pm, 27 Jul, 2019","For three consecutive weekends, Hong Kong police have forcibly dispersed angry crowds as anti-government protests triggered by the now-abandoned extradition bill rage on.; In the crowd was Leonard Cheng Kwok-hon, president of Lingnan University, one of eight publicly funded colleges in Hong Kong. Cheng said he was there as an “observer” because he was worried about the dangers facing students and staff attending the demonstration.","In the northern town of Yuen Long on Saturday, riot police used tear gas, sponge grenades, pepper spray and batons to drive back protesters, who responded with umbrellas, sticks and projectiles. The latest rally came after an armed mob attacked anti-government protesters and passers-by in the area last weekend, injuring at least 45 people. Saturday’s chaotic scenes – broadcast live around the world – lasted well into the night. As of 1am on Sunday, 23 people had been injured, with two in serious condition. Police also arrested a number of people. The government released a statement just after midnight, strongly condemning the protesters for breaching the peace and breaking the law. It added that police would take serious action against violent protesters. “The government deeply regrets that some people still took part in the public procession, and public meeting in Yuen Long, despite the prohibition and objection by the police,” the statement read. “After the public procession, some radical protesters violently charged the police’s cordon lines, vandalised a police vehicle and blocked roads. “The government strongly condemns the protesters for breaching the public peace and breaking the law.” Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan condemned the violence, saying protesters had thrown bricks and bottles with corrosive liquid at police, and had attacked officers with metal rods and removed fences from roads. In response, officers fired tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades when dispersing the crowds, Yu said, but she did not say how many rounds were used. As to why officers from the Special Tactical Squad had entered Yuen Long station at around 10pm and dispersed protesters with batons, Yu said: “Protesters had been throwing fire extinguishers from the bridge of the West Rail Line at police officers on the ground. “We therefore entered the station and took the scene under control.” Earlier in the day, tens of thousands of protesters, in clear defiance of a police ban, took to the streets of Yuen Long, where thugs in white T-shirts had chased protesters, journalists and commuters inside the MTR station and beat them with iron bars and sticks last Sunday. The rampage shocked Hong Kong, giving momentum to the unprecedented protests since early June over the extradition bill that would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including mainland China, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial. Many suspected the attackers in white were paid gangsters or local villagers from Yuen Long. Police confirmed earlier this week that suspected triad members were among the 12 people arrested in connection with the mob violence. At least three groups had applied to hold protests in the town to condemn the assaults. Fearing an escalation of the violence, police made the rare decision to reject the applications, but the demonstration still went ahead. Max Chung Kin-ping, one of the organisers, said 288,000 people turned out for the protest. Police did not give an estimate. Textbook editor Firo Ng, 25, was among those marching. “I am here to say we are not afraid of the white-clad attackers,” Ng said. She also called for an independent inquiry into police actions over the past month. Fresh graduate Brandon Chan, 22, who joined the Yuen Long march and earlier protests against the extradition bill, said he was taking part to show that “we can’t forgo our freedom of assembly and rights” because of fears about triad members. The protesters were also angry about the delayed response from police after the attacks were reported on Sunday evening, and criticised the lack of arrests at the scene. Mostly dressed in black and many wearing heavy masks, the protesters started to stream into Yuen Long in the afternoon. There was no clear leader and the protest was largely peaceful when the march began at around 3.30pm. “Under these circumstances, the students have asked me to come to Yuen Long as an observer of today’s events,” Cheng said. “As the president, what I care about the most is the safety of our students, teachers and alumni. “Today I’m not here to protest or march, I’m here because many of our teachers, students and alumni are here, so I’m here to understand the situation.” One of the enduring images during the Occupy movement in 2014 was when the heads of Hong Kong’s two leading universities visited the pro-democracy protesters, urging them to avoid conflict and stay peaceful. But Cheng’s presence did not have the same impact. The demonstrators were becoming increasingly agitated, and officers bore the brunt of their anger. Water-filled barricades outside Yuen Long Police Station were turned into a “Lennon Wall” where anti-government and anti-police messages were posted. The tension was most palpable outside the walled village of Nam Pin Wai, where scores of men dressed in white were seen last weekend after the attacks, leading many people to believe some of them lived there. “Gangsters, come out and put up a fight,” protesters shouted near the village. Within Nam Pin Wai, villagers were seen wearing helmets and masks, guarding their ancestral hall and other main properties. The two groups were kept separate by fully armed riot police. The stand-off lasted until late afternoon. As tempers frayed on both sides, some protesters threw bricks at officers. A police van was also besieged and vandalised, but the officers inside were not injured. Police said this prompted them to take action, because their officers were at risk. The black banner warning protesters to disperse or face the use of force was unfurled at 5.17pm, and officers fired tear gas into the crowd three minutes later. The now-familiar scene of police and protesters scuffling followed, as a city that until a month ago was known for its safety and order once again descended into chaos. A small group of social workers, lawmakers and others tried to step in and put a stop to the clashes but they were unsuccessful. When some urged police not to fire sponge grenades directly at the protesters, the officers shouted back: “They’re throwing bricks at us!” Most of the protesters left at nightfall but a few hundred stayed and continued to battle officers near the entrances of Yuen Long station, including using fire extinguishers and water hoses to spray police. Officers from the elite Special Tactical Squad moved into the station, making arrests and using batons on some protesters, and blood could be seen on the floor. As the chaos continued into the night, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the city’s senior officials were nowhere to be seen – and the summer of discontent rolled on.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020366/another-weekend-hong-kong-chaos-tear-gas-and-anger
Hong Kong protests: Yuen Long residents keep their heads while all about them lose theirs,"Town deserted as protesters march against mob violence that left 45 injured last weekend; Mixed views over chaotic scenes with some blaming police and triads, and others the protesters","10:44pm, 27 Jul, 2019","Tensions were particularly heightened around the villages, as marchers surrounded the area amid a heavy police presence. Police had earlier rejected the organisers’ application to hold the protest.; In Nam Pin Wai, hundreds of people gathered outside the village believed to be the home of some of the more than 100 men who beat up travellers in Yuen Long MTR station last Sunday.; On the eve of the protests, locals had prepared themselves for any disruption, and many stockpiled food.","As clashes broke out in Yuen Long during protests against the mob violence that rocked the town a week ago, villagers, residents and businesses remained calm. Normally packed with food and nature lovers at the weekend, the suburb town was marred by chaotic scenes on Saturday, as thousands of protesters marched from Shui Pin Tsuen Playground to the Yuen Long MTR station. At least 45 people were injured by the mob in the attack, with some of the victims being those who had marched against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill. Some of the 12 people arrested have been linked with triad gangs. “Gangsters, come out and put up a fight,” some shouted as the march was about 20 metres from the village. Some villagers wore helmets and face masks, but one put up a sign that read: “Come and go safely.” As tensions boiled over, police fired tear gas, and some protesters reacted by dashing towards the canisters to cover them and prevent them from emitting smoke, or even to try and throw them back at officers. A private car was seen smashed up outside Yuen Long Station at around 9pm. Protesters smashed the windshield and broke open the trunk, where they found wooden batons, metal pipes and a samurai style sword. An army style hat was also found inside the car. Protesters suggested the items inside the car resembled weapons used by the men responsible for the attacks last Sunday. Democratic Party lawmaker Roy Kwong Chun-yu said it was wrong for police to fire tear gas on On Lok Road and Tai Cheung Street, as it could affect old people living in several elderly care homes in the area. But an employee at the Friendly Home for the Aged said: “We are not affected, as we closed our windows.” Another staff member at Fu Hong Home for the Elderly said: “Everything went on as usual here, and they [residents] are watching television.” But a 50-year-old unemployed woman, who only identified herself as June, said she was worried when she walked back to her home at a nearby village. “There shouldn’t be chaos,” she said, and complained that the protests had disrupted traffic and forced her to walk 30 minutes back to her home. Still, some residents appeared tolerant. Rachel Lam, 35, who joined the protest with her husband, before the tear gas was fired, said it was police who triggered the chaos. “We were walking peacefully. It was police officers who made it not peaceful,” she said. She said the situation in the afternoon was calm, but admitted her daily life had been affected as she did not dare bring her children outside. The housewife said she had bought food for two to three days, because she did not know whether shops would be closed on Sunday. Another resident, retiree Sammy Lam Kin, 51, said the protests had limited impact on him because he mostly just stayed at home. By midday on Saturday, more than a quarter of shops in Castle Peak Road, around the Tai Tong Road light rail stop in Yuen Long, had closed. Ken Lam, the owner of Dai Won Ton noodle shop, said the number of customers had fallen dramatically. Asked whether he had seen this many businesses shutting their doors before, he said: “Only when a typhoon hits the city.” But Mr Lui, who owns a shop that sells old Hainanese chicken rice, was more at ease, and offered free water to passers-by. “After the violence last Sunday, if we don’t open our shop today, then it will only heighten fears further,” he said. In a Facebook group dedicated to the Yuen Long community, there was a mixed range of views over the protests. A user named Alan To said the march was fine and everyone was happily buying cakes, but “when police and triads arrive, it becomes this chaotic.” Meanwhile, George Hugo called for the “rioters” to be arrested and demanded they “return me my home!” Another user called Tai Man Chan thanked protesters for coming to Yuen Long, but added: “It’s late, please go home soon.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020361/hong-kong-protests-yuen-long-residents-keep-their-heads
"Lingnan University president attends Yuen Long protest with colleagues as ‘observer’, says he is worried about dangers facing students and staff","Varsity president Leonard Cheng asks students to take care of safety and not to be involved in clash; Around 1,000 students, staff and alumni march on campus earlier in the day, demanding expulsion of lawmaker Junius Ho from governing council","7:19pm, 27 Jul, 2019","Cheng, who said he was worried about the dangers facing students and staff, became the first incumbent university chief to show up at a major protest since the Occupy movement of 2014.; Ho roused the anger of many Hongkongers by shaking hands with some men in white T-shirts in Yuen Long, on the night of an indiscriminate attack on passengers at the local MTR station on July 21, that left at least 45 people injured.","President of Hong Kong’s Lingnan University Leonard Cheng Kwok-hon on Saturday took the unusual step of attending the march in Yuen Long as an “observer” for about half an hour, two hours before police officers fired tear gas at protesters. Lingnan University is one of Hong Kong’s eight publicly-funded universities. On October 2, 2014, University of Hong Kong vice-chancellor Peter Mathieson and his Chinese University counterpart Joseph Sung Jao-yiu went down to Admiralty to talk to the crowd in front of the Chief Executive’s Office, pleading with students to avoid conflict and not destroy the movement’s good name. Police said the protest in Yuen Long on Saturday was an unlawful assembly, as they had rejected the organisers’ application for a letter of no objection. Cheng arrived in Yuen Long at 3pm alongside the university’s vice-president Joshua Mok Ka-ho and associate vice-president Lau Chi-pang. Cheng said he was attending the protest only as an “observer” worried about the dangers facing students and staff, but young protesters still cheered, clapped their hands and chanted: “Protect the president!” “The students have asked me to come to Yuen Long as an observer of today’s events,” Cheng said. “As the president, what I care about the most is the safety of our students, teachers and alumni.” He also said he had long reminded them to take care of their own safety and not to be involved in any clash. “This is my bottom line,” he said. “Today I’m not here to protest or march, I’m here because many of our teachers, students and alumni are here. I’m here to understand the situation.” Cheng’s presence in the Yuen Long protest came after organisers said around 1,000 students, staff and alumni of the university attended a rally on the campus earlier in the day, calling for pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu to be expelled from its governing council. Photos have also emerged of Ho having dinner with people dressed in white in Yuen Long on the night of the attack, though it has not yet been established whether they were involved in the violence at the station. Ho’s parents’ graves were desecrated earlier this week, while his office was also trashed. A group of students and alumni, including former lawmaker Nathan Law Kwun-chung of the Demosisto party, marched to Cheng’s office after the rally and demanded a dialogue. Cheng came out and met them, and said he would propose holding a special meeting for the university’s council to discuss the issue. Cheng also said he was concerned about the protest scheduled in the afternoon. Law told Cheng: “As a university chief, it’s your responsibility to protect the students. Would you go to Yuen Long with us today?” Cheng replied: “If you are going to Yuen Long to express your views peacefully and rationally, I can go there with the vice-president to take a look.” Cheung Chor-yung, a senior teaching fellow at the City University’s department of public policy, said Cheng was doing “what every intellectual should do”, even when he knew it would do little to change anything. “Cheng was being responsible. He came out after 1,000 people expressed their discontent, how about our chief executive?” he asked. “The protests have continued for more than a month, how many university presidents or intellectuals have been doing their job?” Cheung also said he appreciated Cheng for going to Yuen Long even though he knew police regarded the march as unlawful. “Compared to the major developments in the city, the lawfulness of the protest was only a minor, technical issue,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020353/lingnan-university-president-attends-yuen-long-protest

"The good, bad and ugly of Yuen Long in Hong Kong, a northern town caught up in extradition bill violence","Last weekend’s vicious mob attack at MTR station threw New Territories district into the limelight as new front opens in escalating political crisis; But beneath the anxiety lies a quaint, rustic neighbourhood that holds fond traditions of old Hong Kong","10:43am, 27 Jul, 2019","Cheng, who said he was worried about the dangers facing students and staff, became the first incumbent university chief to show up at a major protest since the Occupy movement of 2014.; Ho roused the anger of many Hongkongers by shaking hands with some men in white T-shirts in Yuen Long, on the night of an indiscriminate attack on passengers at the local MTR station on July 21, that left at least 45 people injured.","“Whenever people find out I am from Yuen Long, they will ask whether there are cows walking around in the streets,” says 23-year-old Chris Wong, a student at the University of Hong Kong. “I often reply: ‘Yes! I ride one to school every day,” he quips. Wong, who has lived in Long Ping Estate since birth and studied there before going to HKU, says he loves to introduce his hometown as a quaint getaway from the dense city centre. With its low-rise housing and rustic vibe a sharp contrast to the hectic urban lifestyle Hong Kong is mostly associated with, the northern town in the New Territories could not be more different. The district also houses a culturally diverse community with a mix of indigenous villagers, new immigrants and young middle-class couples, as well as ethnic minorities. But a darker side to Yuen Long exists – it is known to be a triad stronghold, with gangs thought to recruit youths from the villages. The most rural parts of Yuen Long are controlled by village heads who also wield political sway over the area and all the way up government echelons. One of the most powerful bodies comprising heads of rural committees is the Heung Yee Kuk, a statutory advisory group representing establishment interests in the New Territories, such as the land rights of indigenous male villagers. As a political crisis grips the city over the now-suspended extradition bill, a new front in the conflict has opened in Yuen Long, thrusting the quiet town into the global limelight after gangs dressed in white last weekend targeted anti-government protesters at the MTR station and also attacked any commuters in their path. Police said more than 100 men with sticks and metal rods stormed Yuen Long station in a vicious assault that left 45 injured, including innocent bystanders and journalists. Attackers were suspected to be members of the notorious 14K and Wo Shing Wo triads. Following Sunday night’s brutality, a large group of white-clad men were seen fleeing into Nam Pin Wai village, an indigenous walled community in the area, blocking its entrance for hours. The incident has thrown the town into anxiety and deepened tensions across the city. A march was planned on Saturday to decry the attacks in Yuen Long but police banned the event. As the organisers have sworn to press on regardless, the town remains a flashpoint for controversy. City Weekend takes a deeper look at Yuen Long, an area within Hong Kong but a world away from the city’s modern reputation. What’s Yuen Long’s history? The vast area is home to more than 635,000 people, consisting of a mix of farms, villages and public housing, as well as modern luxury flats. It is the third most populous district after Sha Tin and Kwun Tong. Typically known for being a farming and trading town, Yuen Long has more than 132 recognised villages dating back to the Song dynasty, including Nam Pin Wai village. During the 1980s, Yuen Long became a second-generation new town when the government began to develop land for more public housing and employment. The town used to be very remote before the MTR network extended its West Rail line in 2003, linking the district, Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun to other parts of the city. With greater accessibility in the past decade, private homes and shopping malls have sprung up, such as Yoho Mall and Yoho Town by Sun Hung Kai Properties. It has attracted an influx of young couples who cannot afford pricey flats in the city centre. Modern restaurant chains and cafes have followed this crowd. At the same time, the cheaper housing options have attracted ethnic minority communities. Almost 7 per cent of Yuen Long’s population comprises ethnic minorities, with a majority being Filipinos and Indonesians. It also has one of the largest concentrations of African residents in the city, with 800 to 1,000 people. Is Yuen Long a hotspot for criminal activity? In 2017, there were 3,651 crime cases reported in Yuen Long, Pat Heung and Tin Shui Wai, a drop from 4,841 in 2016. The most common crimes include criminal damage, serious assault and burglaries. This may be why Yuen Long also has one of the highest numbers of police officers stationed. As of 2017, Yuen Long had 194 crime officers, the highest in the New Territories North region. It also has 796 armed officers, second only to the border district near Shenzhen which has 1,059 armed officers. Police have so far arrested 12 people over the violence at Yuen Long MTR station on Sunday night. Some of the suspects had triad backgrounds, according to police, while sources said 10 of the attackers had fled the city. The gangs implicated are the 14K and Wo Shing Wo, the city’s oldest criminal organisations. 14K’s origins date back to the Chinese civil war, where members conducted transnational criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, according to security publication Jane’s Intelligence Review. Although based locally, the gang has international connections in the US, Russia, Japan, Latin America and Southeast Asia. It has also expanded to mainland China. Recent cases involving triads include gang members attacking a man who had his car parked on Yuen Long Tung Tai street, with more than HK$900,000 stolen from him. In April, police also raided 35 locations around the district and arrested 410 people for their involvement in gambling dens, vice parlours and unlicensed bars. What are the local charms? Despite the area’s dark underbelly, Yuen Long residents hope outsiders do not stereotype their district as a hotbed of crime, stressing that everyday activities for normal residents have been mostly safe. They welcome visitors to their town when things have quietened down, to experience the unique, laid-back charm. “The triads do not bother us as long as we are just living our normal lives. I never feel particularly bothered by them,” resident Chris Wong says. “There is still lots to see in Yuen Long. Please do not let this haunt you.” Michelle Kwok Gahan, a resident who has been living in Yuen Long for five years, agrees. She recommends checking out the cafes dotting Kam Tin District, such as Cohee Studio on Kam Tin Shi Street. “It’s a relaxing environment with a high standard of coffee,” Kwok says. “With quite a lot of newly built malls, infrastructure and residential buildings, the security, especially in these private places is at quite a high level.” Yuen Long also boasts a reputation for being a “food paradise”, with iconic local delights such as traditional offerings from Kei Kee Dessert, beef ball noodles from Victory Beef Ball, or “sweetheart cake” from Hang Heung Cake Shop. Despite becoming more modernised over the past decade, hawkers and dai pai dong-style eateries, or street-side stalls, as well as independent businesses, are still more numerous in the area than large chain outlets. What other controversies has Yuen Long weathered? In 2016, residents of three villages in Yuen Long faced displacement to make way for a housing project in the rural Wang Chau area, after then chief executive Leung Chun-ying approved the construction of 4,000 public housing flats. The move drew the ire of rural village leaders as there were earlier plans to build these houses on a larger site, which could have yielded 13,000 more flats. Pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick made opposing the Wang Chau project part of his winning electoral campaign that year, becoming the “king of votes” in the Legislative Council elections. Because of its proximity to mainland China, local residents often complain about the surge in visitors from across the border, especially after the development of the Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay checkpoints. Locals’ gripes centre on the disruption caused by rowdy shopping tourists. Parallel traders are another source of controversy. They buy up huge quantities of goods, usually cosmetics, milk formula and household items, to sell back across the border for a profit. While they have been accused of depleting stock and driving up prices in local stores, shopkeepers argue they have brought prosperity to the area. In 2015, pro-democratic and localist political parties staged a series of rallies called “Liberate Yuen Long” to protest against parallel trading by mainlanders. What’s next? Pro-democracy demonstrators are planning to hold a rally in Yuen Long on Saturday against the incidents last weekend. The anger is mostly directed at the white-clad mob of attackers, but also against police who were blamed for showing up late. Fears have been heightened after police banned the Saturday march but organisers insisted it would go ahead anyway. Before the police announcement, pro-Beijing lawmaker and rural leader Leung Che-cheung told protesters not to come to Yuen Long this weekend, as he feared a repeat of the violence. Protest organiser and Yuen Long resident Max Chung Kin-ping vowed to push ahead with the event however. “What happened in Yuen Long on July 21 was a terrorist attack and it has aroused widespread concern,” Chung says. “I hope people can stand up and come out to free us from fear.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020331/good-bad-and-ugly-yuen-long-hong-kong-northern-town-caught
Safety measures and stockpiled food as Yuen Long braces for march over Hong Kong violence,"Shops and market stalls look set to close early ahead of march against mob attack that hit subway station last week; Fearing more clashes, some local residents are leaving the city for the weekend","8:00am, 27 Jul, 2019","Cheng, who said he was worried about the dangers facing students and staff, became the first incumbent university chief to show up at a major protest since the Occupy movement of 2014.; Ho roused the anger of many Hongkongers by shaking hands with some men in white T-shirts in Yuen Long, on the night of an indiscriminate attack on passengers at the local MTR station on July 21, that left at least 45 people injured.","Yuen Long residents stockpiled food on Friday, with some even leaving Hong Kong altogether, to brace for potential clashes at protests against mob violence at the district’s subway station a week earlier. Fears heightened locally as police expected as many as 100,000 people to march on Saturday to denounce Sunday’s violence, even though police objected to three rallies, citing safety concerns. Shops and public sports facilities were expected to close early while betting shops, a blood donation centre and health care centre were set to suspend services. Some of the glass doors of a building in Nam Pin Wai, near Yuen Long MTR station, were covered by wooden boards. The village was believed to be home to some of the more than 100 white-clad men who beat up travellers in the station last Sunday, some of whose victims had come from a march against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill. At least 45 people were injured. Some of the 12 people arrested were linked with triad gangs. A village resident in her 40s, who only identified herself as Mrs Wong, had decided to leave the city with her family for a three-day trip to Shenzhen on Friday, saying she did not want to get involved in the chaos. She said she was more worried by the influx of protesters than by the villagers. “We are not scared of the villagers. They are very nice and peaceful,” she said. “It’s the others – too extreme.” Another Yuen Long resident, Fanny Leung, 38, planned to stay at home due to the protests. She said she has stocked up on food for her family. Yuen Long district councillor Mak Ip-sing said some residents, particularly those who lived in the villages, were concerned about the protests. But he said some other residents were not as bothered. “I believe they are peaceful and will not cause trouble in rural villages, as rumours have suggested. So I think it’s not that serious,” he said. He said residents had not fenced off their homes or their villages, but some government officers has glued bricks down in the streets. Some vendors at Tung Yick Market, in the heart of the town, planned to close early on Saturday. “Of course we are scared! We don’t know how chaotic it will be tomorrow afternoon,” Mrs Lau, who sells fish at the wet market, said. “What if our stall opens and the people on the street tomorrow destroy it?” She said the stall would usually stock about 300 catties, or 180kg, of fish, but the owner would only prepare half that amount for the protest day. But vegetable stall owner Mrs Wong was at ease. She said that, thanks to the rumours of trouble, she could increase the price of Chinese cabbage from HK$14 (US$1.80) per catty to HK$16. “Hongkongers are like this. As long as they hear rumours, they believe them,” she said. She said her sales were up 20 per cent because residents feared clashes and bought more food for the next two or three days in advance. Elsewhere in the city, sports shops selling skating helmets and hiking poles recorded an uptick in sales. At Decathlon in Causeway Bay, shelves of hiking poles priced between HK$64 and HK$199 were cleared. Staff said the sudden demand for the poles and helmets started last week. But they were reluctant to say whether it was related to the protest, only saying that: “I don't know. But maybe they just love skating.” Additional reporting by Mark Agnew",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020301/safety-measures-and-stockpiled-food-yuen-long-braces-march
"Worrying new fallout as Hong Kong police decry No 2 official Matthew Cheung’s apology for handling of Yuen Long mob violence, ahead of illegal march that could draw 100,000 protesters",Relations between police and government sour as inspectors say city’s deputy leader has ‘written off’ police efforts; ‘Human wall’ of riot police ready to stop protesters seeking retribution in villages near to route of what would be illegal anti-government march on Sunday,"12:08am, 27 Jul, 2019","A government source later insisted that Cheung was only apologising for the administration’s handling of the extradition bill and not talking about police.; Both the government and police have been under fire over the July 21 violence at Yuen Long MTR station when more than 100 men in white shirts, including suspected triad gangsters, assaulted protesters returning from a mass rally against the now-suspended extradition bill as well as bystanders and other train passengers.; After police issued a letter of objection to the main march planned for Saturday in Yuen Long, citing a serious risk of violence, organiser Max Chung Kin-ping lost an appeal on Friday.","Hong Kong was caught up in worrying new fallout on the eve of an illegal protest march against the government in Yuen Long after the city’s No 2 official angered the embattled police force by publicly apologising for its failure to stop a violent mob rampage in the northern town last Sunday. Stunned police associations were outraged on Friday that they had not been consulted in advance about Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung’s unexpected apology, which they themselves had refused to make, and top brass were seeking an urgent meeting with him. “The government will not shirk its responsibility, and the police’s handling fell short of residents’ expectations,” Cheung said, as he appealed to protesters to express their views in a peaceful manner. “I am absolutely willing to apologise to residents for how it was handled.” The Police Inspectors’ Association hit back in a statement, saying: “Your remarks have shattered our firm belief in our duty. Your words have completely written off our efforts in maintaining law and order over the past few months, and written off our sacrifices, too. You have completely disappointed us. We can’t even understand your words, let alone agree with them.” “The secretary absolutely supports the law enforcement work of the police force and highly commends their efforts. Upon the receipt of an invitation from the police, a meeting will be arranged as soon as possible,” the source said. No police were around to protect the victims in the two late-night attacks that left at least 45 people injured, and officers arrived too late in response to frantic 999 calls. The assailants were said to be from nearby villages that form the social and political power base of the district, and online calls for protesters to retaliate against them have sparked concerns about the risk of violent clashes. He said he would march alone, but police are expecting around 100,000 people to push ahead with what would now be an unlawful assembly. Police also rejected three more applications to hold protest marches in the northern town and in Central and Western districts. Sources told the Post that more than 3,000 police officers would be deployed to maintain order. “Officers in full riot gear will be stationed at the entrance of some of the villages,” one police insider said. “Officers will form a human wall if protesters try to storm into villages.” Other sources said police would arrest protesters on the spot if they turned up in manageable numbers, but a mass rally would have to be handled differently. If protesters attack police lines despite repeated warnings, another source said, officers will use tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge-tipped rounds to disperse them. Yuen Long residents were preparing for a state of siege, stockpiling food in advance. After it was besieged and pelted with eggs and paint balls by protesters last week, Beijing’s liaison office in Western District was taking no chances ahead of another march planned for Sunday from Central to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park, which is just 1km (0.6 miles) away from the office. While heavy water-filled barricades had been set up to protect the building front on Friday, the march was also banned by police, who only agreed to an assembly at Chater Garden in Central. The mass protests that erupted early last month were first triggered by the extradition bill that would have allowed the transfer of suspects to mainland China, but have escalated into wider outpourings of grievances against the government. Groups in public service, including civil servants, hospital staff and airport workers, have been issuing statements or holding rallies against the government and police in support of the protest movement. Aviation workers were among an estimated 15,000 protesters who staged a marathon sit-in at Hong Kong International Airport on Friday, while more than 100 elite civil servants spoke out as well. Among their demands were calls for the city’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, to appoint a judge-led commission of inquiry to investigate the roots of the crisis as well as the use of force by police. Police are strongly against such an inquiry because of the insinuation that their conduct was questionable when they themselves have complained of being attacked and abused by protesters. For the first time, the Department of Justice also waded in, with 20 government lawyers distancing themselves from the administration in an anonymous statement and pledging to protect citizens’ rights. “Whatever our personal political stance may be, we have always adhered to the rule of law,” they said. “Nevertheless, we, as Hong Kong citizens and members of the legal profession, will resolutely defend the fundamental human rights of Hong Kong people, enshrined in the Basic Law.” In an open letter to Lam, five former and current leaders of the pro-business Liberal Party echoed the calls for the inquiry and the complete withdrawal of the bill. Party leader Felix Chung Kwok-pan went a step further, writing in a column that the chief executive “should leave if the current chaos has been unbearable for her”.

Beijing says People’s Liberation Army is a ‘pillar of stability’ for Hong Kong,"Troops will continue to serve city in accordance with the law, foreign ministry spokeswoman says; Official accuses protest group of ‘inviting wolf into their homes’ with its appeal for support from foreign consulates","9:30pm, 26 Jul, 2019","On Thursday, Charles Li Xiaojia, head of the Hong Kong stock exchange, cautioned against Chinese military intervention, saying the PLA should not be doing the job of the Hong Kong police.","The People’s Liberation Army is a pillar for stability in Hong Kong and will always abide by the law, Beijing said on Friday amid concerns it might mobilise troops to help bring an end to weeks of unrest in the city. “I want to say that the PLA in Hong Kong has always strictly abided by the Basic Law and the Garrison Law since the [1997] handover, and has faithfully carried out their defence duties,” China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a press conference in Beijing, referring to the Hong Kong’s mini-constitution. “The PLA in Hong Kong has been a pillar for the city’s long-term prosperity and stability,” she said, adding that Beijing would continue to support stability in Hong Kong but would not allow foreign forces to interfere in its affairs.  On Wednesday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said that the protesters’ recent actions and vandalism of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong had challenged Beijing’s baseline. He also said that the PLA’s role in Hong Kong was clearly stipulated by law. On Thursday, a US State Department spokeswoman said Washington had “note[d] with concern the Chinese government’s statements”. “We urge Beijing to adhere to its commitments in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Basic Law to allow Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy,” she said, referring to the binding documents that stipulate the city’s administrative autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also urged China to “do the right thing” in dealing with protests in Hong Kong and called on all sides to refrain from using violence. “The president, I think, captured it right when he said that we need China to do the right thing,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, referring to US President Donald Trump. “We hope that they’ll do that, we hope that the protests will remain peaceful.” China and the US have traded barbs over Hong Kong in recent weeks. Earlier this week, Hua accused the US of being the “black hand” behind the disruption in the city, which the US State Department brushed off as a “false charge”, saying the protesters’ concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy were “legitimate”. Though analysts say the prospect of military intervention is extremely unlikely because of the high political cost, Wu’s remarks fuelled concern among the Hong Kong public that the PLA’s hitherto dormant presence in the city could change. Hong Kong’s next demonstrations are set to take place on Saturday in Yuen Long – where a gang of thugs launched a vicious attack on members of the public at the town’s subway station on Sunday – and the following day in the city’s western district. Local police refused permission for the Yuen Long protest, but organisers said it would go ahead nonetheless. Meanwhile, the Civil Human Rights Front – which has organised earlier protests but is not directly involved in this weekend’s events – has called on foreign consulates to issue travel warnings for the city in light of the violence in Yuen Long and to press the government for greater protection for foreign nationals living in the city. Hua likened the group’s call to “inviting the wolf into your home”. “I think everyone can see clearly the real nature of such behaviour. It is to instigate foreign forces to interfere in Hong Kong’s affairs, and to put pressure on the central government and the Hong Kong government,” she said. “I call on those who want to invite the wolf into their homes to study history. Did anyone who colluded with foreign forces to bring ruin to the country and its people ever have a good ending?”",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020287/beijing-says-peoples-liberation-army-pillar-stability-hong
Police anger after Hong Kong No 2 Matthew Cheung says sorry for Yuen Long attack response,"‘The police force’s handling of the incident that night falls short of people’s expectations,’ Cheung says; Police chief seeks urgent meeting, saying he was kept in the dark about the apology","5:53pm, 26 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong police officers were up in arms on Friday, accusing the government of writing off their efforts and making them question their duty after the city’s deputy leader apologised for how the force handled an outbreak of mob violence in Yuen Long last week.","The unexpected remarks by Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung also prompted Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung to seek an urgent meeting with Cheung. The force said top brass had been kept in the dark about the apology, which came on the eve of planned marches in the northern district to decry the police’s slow response to the Sunday-night attack. In that incident, a white-clad mob attacked protesters and some passers-by at Yuen Long subway station, just hours after a march against the now-suspended extradition bill ended on Hong Kong Island. They injured 45 people. By the time police officers arrived, the attackers had left the scene. The Hong Kong Police Inspectors’ Association issued a letter to Cheung venting its disappointment. It said officers were caught between the government and protesters, and Cheung’s remarks had shattered officers’ belief in their duty. “Over the past few months we have been violently charged and verbally abused. Off-duty we suffer online abuse, harassment and provocation. Even our family members were insulted and threatened,” the letter read. “But the entire force still stood fast and carried out our duties. We did not hold back. We did not complain. Because we believe we are the last defence of the administration.” “Your words have completely written off our efforts in maintaining law and order over the past few months, and written off our sacrifices, too. You have completely disappointed us.” The association urged Cheung to meet its representatives as soon as possible. Anonymous angry letters, accompanied by pictures of police warrant cards or badges, were circulating online, urging Cheung to step down and apologise to the force. “Police were being blamed for whatever they did. Now you are making things worse,” one letter read. “The government gave us up, after we defended them for nearly two months. We took bullets for the administration,” said an inspector who had been working since the first extradition bill protest broke out in June. “I was in shock when I came across the apology. Is it fair to all of us? The government owes us an apology instead!” said the visibly emotional officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The force’s personnel wing issued an internal memo three hours after Cheung’s remarks, saying Lo and other managers did not know about the apology in advance and would seek a meeting with Cheung as soon as possible, along with the four police associations. “The commissioner of police will attend the meeting himself together with the four associations’ representatives,” the memo read. “We understand our officers in Yuen Long district have been criticised widely lately. But they still need to handle a very complicated mass public order event on Saturday. The director of operations will visit and meet with frontline officers in the district today.” Earlier in the day, Cheung, who described the white-clad men behind the attacks as “rioters”, urged extradition bill protesters to demonstrate “peacefully and rationally” in the town on Saturday. He said the government would take responsibility for its handling of the attack. “We are all very upset about the whole incident ... The government will not shirk its responsibility, and the police’s handling fell short of residents’ expectations. I am absolutely willing to apologise to residents for how it was handled,” Cheung said. In describing the white-shirted attackers as rioters for the first time, Cheung’s remarks went further than those of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who was widely criticised for refusing to apologise on Monday following the overnight violence, and for condemning protesters who vandalised the national emblem at Beijing’s liaison office before mentioning the Yuen Long attack. On Thursday, the police’s acting New Territories North regional commander Anthony Tsang Ching-fo also stopped short of apologising, acknowledging only that “there was a bit of a gap between our operation … and the expectations of the public”. Addressing protesters’ demand for an independent inquiry into the policing of recent protests, Cheung repeated the government’s position that established mechanisms – such as those within the Independent Police Complaints Council – could deal with the matter, but he said the government was in “reflective mode” and would look at ways to engage more with society.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020251/hong-kong-no-2-matthew-cheung-says-sorry-police-response
One in seven of Hong Kong’s elite civil servants call on Carrie Lam to hold independent inquiry into extradition bill unrest but police unions remain firmly opposed,"Over 100 serving administrative officers sign petition, saying city is at ‘crossroads of right and wrong’ and inquiry is needed for society to move on; It is the fourth call this week by government employees for the government to respond to the crisis but four police unions say any inquiry would be ‘unfair’","2:53pm, 26 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong police officers were up in arms on Friday, accusing the government of writing off their efforts and making them question their duty after the city’s deputy leader apologised for how the force handled an outbreak of mob violence in Yuen Long last week.","One in seven of the elite civil servants who form the backbone of the Hong Kong government have spoken out about the city’s recent unrest in response to the unpopular extradition bill, joining the chorus for an independent inquiry into the whole saga to truly “reconcile, recover, and move forward”. But their call for an investigation was rebuffed by four police unions, who said that any inquiry would be unfair and urged the embattled city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to “resolutely oppose” the call so as not to let down the force which has supported her administration. The unprecedented move by over 100 serving administrative officers (AO) came as the Civil Service Bureau arranged two dialogue sessions for junior bureaucrats, in which they were reminded to observe the principle of neutrality. It had received support from some 20 government lawyers, who posted a statement on an online forum on Friday, distancing themselves from the administration, and vowing to stand up for human rights. “Public duty cannot override the constitutional rights of civil servants, and the political stance of political appointees absolutely does not represent the view of civil servants,” the government lawyers wrote. In an anonymous petition on Friday, some 100 out of a total of 650 AOs said the city was at a “crossroads of right and wrong” after top officials turned a deaf ear to the public, causing the government to lose credibility. They “solemnly and humbly” appealed to Lam to listen and respond to demands from civil society to establish an independent commission of inquiry to look into the legislative process, as well as whether police committed misconduct in their delayed response to the indiscriminate assault by alleged gangsters on commuters in Yuen Long on Sunday. “This is the only way that Hong Kong will have the opportunity to reconcile, recover from the trauma and move forward again,” they said, with their staff cards attached showing their respective rankings and their names covered. In the collage, at least three staff cards belonged to principal assistant secretaries – the first rung in the four-tier directorate grade – and multiple assistant secretaries. The signatories stressed they had no intention of eroding the principle of political neutrality that bound them, but they said the administration must rebuild mutual confidence between the people and the government to allow civil servants to discharge their duties. “It will pain us if we are to see the image of civil servants, which has been built across decades, be destroyed in a flash,” they wrote. No 2 official Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said he respected freedom of expression, but did not respond on whether the petition could run against the principle of neutrality. The statement echoed a similar call from over 500 executive officers made on Wednesday to press the Lam administration to respond to the demands of protesters, while a separate group even threatened to take industrial action if the government did not respond by mid-August. The four police unions, representing superintendents, inspectors, overseas inspectors and junior police, reiterated their outright opposition to conducting an independent inquiry, and noted that recent protests had turned into violent clashes across the city. Meanwhile, some 1,500 public hospital workers held a rally at Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Friday to condemn the mob violence in Yuen Long last Sunday – in which men in white T-shirts, including suspected gangsters, beat protesters and other MTR users – and police’s belated response. Most of the doctors, nurses, radiographers and other practitioners who spoke at the rally also urged the government to conduct an independent probe into the policing of protests. Dr Alfred Wong Yam-hong, who leads a pro-democracy doctors group, said while his peers had upheld their professional code of conduct by caring for patients regardless of their political persuasions, the police force had not been as impartial. Registered nurse Kenny Yeung was on his way home and arrived at Yuen Long MTR station when the violence broke out on Sunday, and though fearful and angry, he provided first aid to injured passengers in a toilet. “I wanted to help more people, but as soon as I went out I saw the white-shirt thugs wielding wooden sticks and metal rods at people, and I had no choice but to go back into the toilet,” he said. Separately, about 500 medical students attended a rally at Chinese University on Friday with similar demands. “We are trained in medical school to care for all patients, but the indiscriminate attack on civilians at a train station on Sunday really pained and angered me. I feel I have no choice but to voice out.” At the Trade Development Council, another public body, over 120 employees anonymously issued a statement with similar demands. “We feel that the Hong Kong public and the international society have lost faith in officials and police,” they wrote in the open letter. “How could we work with [the government and the police] and continue to promote Hong Kong’s trade?”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020206/one-seven-hong-kongs-elite-civil-servants-call-carrie-lam

At least 45 people, both protesters and commuters, were injured when they were attacked by about 100 men wearing white T-shirts on Sunday. Some local activists have questioned if Beijing had anything to do with the attacks. Li Jiyi, the director of the liaison office’s New Territories office, gave a speech at a community event with hundreds of villagers and district councillors on July 11. In a recording obtained by the Post, he appeared to encourage locals to resist protests in their neighbourhood. “No one dared to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble. I believe we have prepared well over the past months. We would not allow them to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble,” he said, before being interrupted by a burst of applause. “Even though there is a group of protesters trained to throw bricks and iron bars, we still have a group of courageous Yuen Long residents determined to maintain social peace and protect our homeland.” Li said Hong Kong’s development went hand in hand with national development, stressing the need for social harmony and unity. Pan-democrat district councillor Zachary Wong Wai-yin, who attended the event, said he believed Li’s remarks played a role in the violence that followed. Yet, Hong Kong China News Agency reported on Thursday that a spokesman for Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong “strongly condemned malicious rumours” that the office was behind the violence, and said it reserved its legal right to follow up on them. “It was groundless to associate the liaison office with the violence in Yuen Long … Just like Hong Kong residents, the liaison office has firmly opposed and reprimanded any form of violent act,” the spokesman added. In another statement, the Chinese foreign ministry’s office in Hong Kong denounced remarks by US senator Marco Rubio, who alleged that the Communist Party had “used organised crime groups to attack protesters in Hong Kong”. Xinhua also published a commentary early on Friday morning, pointing to foreign forces allegedly behind the Hong Kong protests. “Recently, the United States, Britain and other countries have deeply interfered in Hong Kong affairs. Remarks of officials and politicians, and the Western media reports, are full of morbid thinking and double standards,” the Xinhua commentary read. Meanwhile, the liaison office, which is based in Western district, has been taking additional measures ahead of a protest that is set to end at the nearby Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park on Sunday, according to a source at the office. Water and metal barricades have been installed outside the building’s front and rear entrances on Friday. The source also said food and water supplies for staff in the building had been replenished, while more security guards and officers would be deployed for Friday night and the weekend. The security alert for the building had been at its highest level since a group of protesters laid siege to it last Sunday and defaced the national emblem hanging on its facade. Speaking on Friday morning on a radio programme, Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank, said the police needed to review their strategy for protecting the liaison office.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020184/beijings-liaison-office-hong-kong-hits-out-accusations-it
"Hong Kong police confirm use of sponge grenades, rubber bullets and 55 cans of tear gas against extradition bill protesters during clash at Sheung Wan","Head of police public relations says, ‘We think the force we used was lawful and proportionate’; Softer, larger grenades are less lethal than rubber bullets, says military analyst","8:00am, 26 Jul, 2019","Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong has condemned those who accused it of being behind violent attacks in the northern town of Yuen Long on Sunday, as the foreign ministry also slammed US senator Marco Rubio for making a similar claim.; “I believed Li’s remark was an order to mobilise,” he said, adding that from July 11 to 21, some young people were also driven away by villagers and rural leaders as they tried to create a Lennon Wall or hand out leaflets to promote their cause.","Police fired sponge grenades at extradition bill protesters last Sunday in what some say was the first use of the riot-control weapon in Hong Kong’s history. In a press briefing on Thursday, police officials said the force used 55 cans of tear gas, five rounds of rubber bullets and 24 sponge grenades – designed to cause blunt pain and trauma – on July 21. Anti-extradition protesters – some of whom vandalised Beijing’s liaison office in Sai Ying Pun, defacing the building and China’s national emblem – clashed with riot police in Sheung Wan on Sunday. Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung, head of the police public relations bureau, said officers had no choice but to deploy the weapons as protesters were throwing bricks. “We think the force we used was lawful and proportionate,” Tse said. Tse did not elaborate on the power of the sponge grenades or the force’s protocol for using them. The grenades – 40mm in diameter – can cause “serious injury or death” if used incorrectly, according to manufacturer Pacem Defense. Liang Guoliang, a city-based military analyst, said sponge grenades were less lethal than rubber bullets because they were softer and larger. “Sponge grenades are most effective when shots are made within 10 metres,” Liang said. “If the distance is above 50 metres, they are generally useless.” Designed in 1999, sponge grenades had not become a conventional weapon for riot police around the world because, according to Liang, they are “not very effective for frontline officers to load the launchers.” Before the clash escalated, Tse said officers had issued warnings in a blanket manner, meaning they apply to the whole protest site. Tse also said it was not possible for the officers to issue warning at every instance before using force against protesters. Icarus Wong Ho-yin, a human-rights activist and member of Civil Rights Observer, said police should have issued clearer warnings. He said protesters might not have been able to see what warning had been issued because the scene was obscured by clouds of tear gas. Wong also said police should not have opened fire from footbridges. “From footbridges, the shots could land on someone’s head or upper body,” Wong said. Separately, a 23-year-old local was arrested in Wan Chai on Thursday morning for wounding two police officers at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin on July 14, when officers clashed with protesters, resulting in at least 28 injuries. Police said the man was among a group of protesters who surrounded and attacked two male plain clothes officers with fists and feet and umbrellas, inflicting facial fractures on one and head wounds to another, along with other injuries. Police said there could be more arrests. Additional reporting by Danny Mok",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3020127/hong-kong-police-confirm-use-sponge-grenades-rubber
China’s top television news show runs week of reports slamming Hong Kong protesters,CCTV’s prime-time evening programme takes aim at all aspects of recent marches and violent clashes; Mainland journalist says media companies under strict orders to use only Communist Party approved content in reports on situation in Hong Kong,"8:00am, 26 Jul, 2019","Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong has condemned those who accused it of being behind violent attacks in the northern town of Yuen Long on Sunday, as the foreign ministry also slammed US senator Marco Rubio for making a similar claim.; “I believed Li’s remark was an order to mobilise,” he said, adding that from July 11 to 21, some young people were also driven away by villagers and rural leaders as they tried to create a Lennon Wall or hand out leaflets to promote their cause.","China’s most watched daily television news programme has aired a series of damning reports about the anti-government protesters in Hong Kong and blamed “external forces” for helping to disrupt order in the city. State broadcaster CCTV’s prime-time evening news programme Xinwen Lianbo began the run on Saturday with a report promoting the “Protect Hong Kong” rally organised by Beijing supporters at Tamar Park in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong. Subsequent reports covered the violent protests outside Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong on Sunday night when protesters sprayed anti-China slogans on the wall of the building and splashed black paint on the national emblem. On Thursday, the programme interviewed businesspeople and Hong Kong residents who said the city’s economy would suffer if the protests continued. Johnny Wei, 45, a businessman who lives in Zhaoqing in the southern mainland province of Guangdong, said he was in tears when he watched the reports. “I knew about the protests in Hong Kong but I was still shocked when I saw the national emblem covered in black paint,” he said. “I had tears in my eyes. This was too much. I respect their right to protest but they should not insult our country,” he said. On CCTV’s official Weibo account, most of the 3,000 comments that accompanied the video clips of the protests at the liaison office were critical of the protesters. Other state media, including People’s Daily and Xinhua, also carried strongly worded commentaries on the protests. Xiake Dao, a social media account affiliated with the overseas edition of People’s Daily, published a commentary accusing Hong Kong and Western media of “playing a disgraceful role” in fanning the flames of the month-long unrest in the city. A Communist Party official, who works at the liaison office and was on duty on Sunday night, said he was shocked by the violence and the rage shown by the protesters. “Things are very different this time [compared with previous protests],” he said. “This is the first time since the 1997 handover that the national emblem has been vandalised and I heard [the protesters chanting] slogans like, ‘It’s time for revolution’ and ‘recover Hong Kong’.” “I see this as a watershed event and I am not the only one here who feels that way,” the official said on condition of anonymity. Xinwen Lianbo did not interview any Hong Kong government officials or police about the protests. On Tuesday, the programme’s reports included criticism by China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying who claimed Washington had instigated the protests in Hong Kong, but did not elaborate. A journalist who works for the Guangzhou Daily group but asked not to be identified, said that newspaper editors in the mainland had been told they must toe the official line when reporting events in Hong Kong. “On reports about Hong Kong, we are under strict orders to use copy provided by state media like Xinhua or CCTV, and we can only carry official statements released by official departments,” said the journalist, who asked not to be named. Wu Junfei, deputy director of the Tianda Institute, a think tank in Hong Kong, said: “Xinwen Lianbo is the most important channel for Chinese leaders to communicate their agenda to the public. The lengthy reports and commentaries about Hong Kong show that the leadership in Beijing is taking the situation very seriously and wants to communicate a clear position to the mainland and the rest of the world.” Despite the criticism, Beijing had shown some restraint, he said. “We can see that the central government has been cautious on Hong Kong, and has only called the protests ‘violent incidents’ and not ‘riots’ in the hope that order can be restored in the city soon.” But Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said he believed the storming of the Legco building on July 1 and Sunday’s protest at the liaison office had pushed Beijing’s leaders to take a tougher stance and send a strong message on the importance of stability. “The storming of the Legco building and vandalising of the liaison office have given Beijing the justification to attack the anti-government protesters, who are now being described as violent people who destroy public property, attack the police and cause great losses for the Hong Kong public. “But the reports have not provided a proper explanation [of what caused the protests],” he said. “So mainlanders who watched the programmes will get the impression that the protesters who opposed the extradition bill are troublemakers who want Hong Kong to break away from China, and that is obviously against the will of almost all mainland Chinese.” Wu said that as Beijing blocked access to many foreign news sites and other sources of information, most mainlanders did not have access to unbiased information and tended to believe Beijing’s propaganda. “Even in the case of the mob attacks in Yuen Long on Sunday night [when a gang of thugs randomly attacked Hong Kong subway users], most mainlanders believe that the ‘unpatriotic’ protesters deserved to be beaten as they only have access to one side of the story.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3020119/chinas-top-television-news-show-runs-week-reports-slamming-hong
US state department worried by Beijing’s hints it could use troops to put down Hong Kong protests,‘We urge Beijing to adhere to its commitments in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Basic Law to allow Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy’; State Department ‘categorically rejects’ charge from Beijing that US government has acted as a ‘black hand’ in ongoing unrest,"6:54am, 26 Jul, 2019","Though analysts say the prospect of military intervention is extremely unlikely due to the political cost, Wu’s remarks fuelled concerns among Hongkongers that the PLA’s hitherto dormant presence in the city could change, particularly given memories of the Chinese military’s bloody crackdown on protesters in Beijing 30 years ago.","The United States government has expressed concern about recent statements by a senior Chinese military official suggesting that mainland forces could be deployed in Hong Kong to quell dissent on the city’s streets. “We note with concern the Chinese government’s statements,” a state department spokeswoman told the South China Morning Post on Thursday. “We urge Beijing to adhere to its commitments in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Basic Law to allow Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy,” she said, referring to the binding documents that stipulate the city’s administrative autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework. The comments came a day after Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said that protesters’ recent actions were challenging Beijing’s baseline and made clear that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was legally permitted to maintain law and order under the city’s Garrison Law. “Some behaviour of the radical protesters is challenging the authority of the central government and the bottom line of one country, two systems,” said Wu, who singled out protesters’ recent vandalism of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong. Concern crested in Washington, too, with lawmakers on Wednesday calling for a swift rebuke from the US government. “The Trump administration should strongly and publicly condemn any threats to Hong Kong citizens and US residents of Hong Kong,” senator Marco Rubio and representative James McGovern said in a statement. “We also ask the Hong Kong government to condemn the Chinese government’s threats as unwelcome interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.” Protests against Beijing's influence over Hong Kong have raged through the city for nearly two months, prompted by a proposed amendment to Hong Kong law that would have allowed the extradition of suspects to mainland China. The state department on Thursday expressed support for protesters’ “broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy”, which it said threatened the city’s place in international affairs. Beijing has shot back against any critique from foreign governments over the protests, accusing – without evidence – US government officials on Tuesday of being behind the ongoing unrest. The state department said it “categorically reject[ed] the false charge of foreign forces as the black hand behind the protests”, referring to an allegory often employed by Beijing to refer to external interference. Protesters – who have faced riot-control-level tactics from Hong Kong police, including rubber pellets, tear gas and batons – came up against a new form of resistance over the weekend when gangs of white-clad men apparently belonging to organised crime groups set upon demonstrators with metal poles and bats. The indiscriminate violence, which took place in the border town of Yuen Long north of the city, left 45 people injured, including journalists and other passers-by. The US state department said on Thursday that reports of “organised violence by criminal gangs against private citizens, and attacks on journalists trying to do their jobs, are particularly disturbing.” “We urge all sides to exercise restraint and refrain from violence,” its spokeswoman said. Accusations of complicity in Sunday’s attacks by Hong Kong authorities have swirled since it was revealed that it took about 40 minutes for police to arrive at the scene, charges the city’s leadership has denied. Allegations of collusion were also fuelled following the release of footage showing a pro-establishment lawmaker shaking hands with and thanking a group of men in white T-shirts on Sunday evening. The lawmaker, Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, has continued to grab headlines since then with his defence of the mob’s right to defend their “home and people”, an apparent death threat made against a pro-democracy lawmaker via Facebook, and an interview with Chinese state media on Thursday in which he said the PLA could intervene to “stabilise the political situation”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020142/us-state-department-worried-beijings-hints-it-could-use-troops
‘Let the police do their job’: Hong Kong stock exchange chief cautions against military intervention,"PLA’s role is to protect national sovereignty and ‘one country, two systems’ should be safeguarded, Charles Li says","8:23pm, 25 Jul, 2019","Though analysts say the prospect of military intervention is extremely unlikely due to the political cost, Wu’s remarks fuelled concerns among Hongkongers that the PLA’s hitherto dormant presence in the city could change, particularly given memories of the Chinese military’s bloody crackdown on protesters in Beijing 30 years ago.","The head of the Hong Kong stock exchange has cautioned against Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong, saying it is not up to the People’s Liberation Army to do the police’s job. Addressing a group of business and professional executives on Thursday, HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the PLA was “supposed to be here to ... point [at] outside enemies. It’s not supposed to help Hong Kong to deal with our own problems.” Li’s comments come amid concerns that PLA troops could be mobilised to help maintain order in the city, after weeks of protests. He told a gathering organised by the Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute that the principle of “one country, two systems” – under which the city retains its own political, legal, economic and financial systems – should be safeguarded and the PLA’s purpose was to protect national sovereignty. “The PLA is in Hong Kong in the garrison to protect national sovereignty, to protect national territorial integrity, integration and integrity of the People’s Republic of China,” Li said. He said police should be allowed to do their job properly. “The only time that we can have that conversation [about deploying the PLA] is because our police force cannot deal with these problems any more. You may not like the police but it doesn’t really matter. You need them to do the job,” Li said. “If somebody does something wrong, deal with it. But otherwise, we have to let them do their jobs.” He said that if there came a time when the police could not do their job, “we are all going to be in a land that nobody wanted”. “I don’t think that’s the place any Hong Kong people wanted. I don’t think that’s a place where the central government wanted us to be linked,” Li said. Concerns over whether troops from the PLA garrison in Hong Kong could be deployed have heightened since Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said on Wednesday that the Chinese military was following the developments in Hong Kong closely, especially the vandalism against the central government’s liaison office on Sunday. Wu also referred to the Garrison Law, which allows the PLA to help the city maintain law and order at the request of Hong Kong’s government. The remarks raised fears that the military had sent a warning, but a Hong Kong government spokesman said the city was fully capable of keeping public order and there was no need to ask for help. “There is no need to ask for assistance from the [Hong Kong PLA] garrison,” the spokesman said. In Washington, US Representative James McGovern and Senator Marco Rubio called on the White House to “condemn the threat to deploy the PLA in Hong Kong”. Rubio and McGovern said the “threats of intervention by the People’s Liberation Army in Hong Kong are unacceptable and needlessly escalate tensions”. “The Trump administration should strongly and publicly condemn any threats to Hong Kong citizens and US residents of Hong Kong. We also ask the Hong Kong government to condemn the Chinese government’s threats as unwelcome interference in Hong Kong’s affairs,” they said. Earlier, Rubio also called for condemnation of a violent attack on Sunday in Yuen Long, a town in Hong Kong’s New Territories, where men in white shirts and armed with sticks and metal rods beat up commuters indiscriminately. “People that put in power thugs and criminals and gangsters to go after innocent people and beat them the way they did, we should be condemning it, but the whole world should be condemning it. They can now see the true nature of that government of that Communist Party,” he said. Beijing hit back at the comments, with the Chinese foreign ministry’s commissioner’s office in Hong Kong saying Rubio had damaged ties between Hong Kong and mainland China and spread “lies” about Hong Kong. “Rubio has attacked China with malicious intent for a long time,” the office said. “He has made groundless lies for political gain. And he has stirred up trouble in the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland, with ulterior motives.” The office also accused some US politicians of double standards, saying they condemned violence in the United States while describing those who attacked Hong Kong police and government buildings as “freedom fighters”. Analysts said any intervention by the Chinese military would be a last resort because of the huge political cost and great complexities involved. It would also mean the end of the one country, two systems formula, they said. But, Leung Chun-ying, the city’s former chief executive, said on his Facebook page that PLA intervention would not mean “the death of one country, two systems” because the Basic Law stipulated that PLA troop deployment was permissible. Leung said he hoped the troops would not be mobilised, but that violence should be stopped. “I hope that the articles in the Basic Law that concern PLA troops carrying out duties will not be executed, and that Hong Kong police can effectively control the situation. But the destructive forces, both in front and behind the scenes, should immediately stop attacking the police and all violent acts,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3020094/let-police-do-their-job-hong-kong-stock-exchange-chief-cautions
"Organiser vows to push ahead with Yuen Long march after Hong Kong police refuse permission, citing safety concerns","Force took advice from rural leaders, but organiser says this only fuels suspicions that officers are colluding with them; Northern town has become flashpoint in latest escalation of conflict from extradition bill crisis","4:06pm, 25 Jul, 2019","The organiser of a potentially chaotic protest march planned for Saturday in Hong Kong’s northern town of Yuen Long has vowed to push on even though it would be an illegal assembly after police banned the gathering, citing a serious risk of violence.","In a rare move, police on Thursday issued a letter of objection to the march, saying it was to ensure public order and safety, and to protect the rights and freedoms of others who would be affected, even as the organiser and scores of defiant citizens promised to go ahead regardless of the legal consequences. “The march is triggered by the violent incidents last Sunday and protesters have showed hostility towards some Yuen Long residents,” acting New Territories North regional commander Anthony Tsang Ching-fo said on Thursday. “There is a fairly high chance for both sides to clash.” The planned march to Yuen Long’s MTR station to condemn a mob who went on a shocking rampage there on Sunday night, and to criticise the government and police for failing to protect the victims, has raised fears of more violence because of calls for retaliation against nearby villages where the attackers were believed to have come from. At least 45 people were injured when more than 100 men in white T-shirts, including suspected triad gangsters, attacked anyone in their path with sticks and iron rods. They were targeting people wearing black – the colour of the protest movement against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill – but beat up train passengers, passers-by and journalists at the scene, with no police around to stop them. Reflecting tensions in the primarily rural district, Tsang said the march would end near several villages, and police had reason to believe clashes would erupt between protesters and villagers. Nam Pin Wai village in particular was where most of the white-clad men were seen gathering that night, and believed to be the home of some of the attackers. Tsang stressed that allowing the march would have meant ignoring public appeals, after community leaders, university presidents and more than 1,000 citizens raised concerns about the possibility of chaos. Authorities are worried that Yuen Long town will not be able to accommodate masses of protesters running loose on the streets, which are criss-crossed with tracks for northern Hong Kong’s light rail transit system. While police warned that anyone joining the march would be breaking the law, they promised to deploy extra manpower to manage crowd control, ensure public safety and handle transport disruptions. Protest organiser Max Chung Kin-ping vowed to defy the ban, which he described as a “political move” that would provoke an even larger turnout. The rejection would only fuel anger over the perception that police were “colluding” with rural powers, Chung said. Tsang denied acting out of fear of rural leaders who have a dominant power base in the district. Kenneth Lau Ip-keung, head of the powerful Heung Yee Kuk rural body, said he was glad police had turned down the march application. He urged both protesters and villagers to remain calm, and advised local residents to stay at home if possible to avoid any trouble. He also called for police to increase their presence for the sake of law and order. Ching Chan-ming, chairman of the Shap Pat Heung Rural Committee, warned protesters not to make good on threats to storm villages and damage ancestral halls. “We won’t make trouble, but we won’t walk away from trouble,” he said, warning that many villagers had agricultural tools at home to defend themselves. “If they are provoked, villagers will protect their homes.” Meanwhile those who support the march have been brainstorming online for creative ways to circumvent the police ban. One idea was to hold a “memorial” for former Chinese Premier Li Peng, despised by many in Hong Kong for his leading role in the Tiananmen Square crackdown, after his death this week. They noted the Public Order Ordinance stated that regulation of public meetings did not apply to gatherings exclusively “for the purpose of a funeral”, or purposes of religious or cultural discussion. Barrister Billy Li On-yin, convenor of the Progressive Lawyers’ Group, accused police of stripping Hongkongers of their right to peaceful protest. “They could have imposed certain conditions to prevent the marchers from going close to the villages,” he said. At the press conference to announce the ban, Tsang also admitted there might be “room for improvement” in light of police turning up too late to protect the victims of Sunday’s attacks, but he refused to apologise. “We understand there was a bit of a gap between our operation ... and the expectations of the public,” he said. “We are deeply saddened at not being able to prevent the incident and the injuries suffered by members of the public.” Additional reporting by Kimmy Chung and Sum Lok-kei",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3020061/hong-kong-police-ban-yuen-long-protest-march-rare-decision
Civil servants threaten strike in frustration over police handling of Hong Kong unrest as 'Lennon Wall' appears in Policy Innovation and Coordination Office,"Department is brainchild of city’s leader, hiring young researchers as part of her election manifesto to reach out to youth; Heads of five disciplinary forces however pledge support for administration even as online wave of staff resentment rolls","11:00am, 25 Jul, 2019","The organiser of a potentially chaotic protest march planned for Saturday in Hong Kong’s northern town of Yuen Long has vowed to push on even though it would be an illegal assembly after police banned the gathering, citing a serious risk of violence.","Hundreds of Hong Kong civil servants and government employees have anonymously aired their frustrations against the city’s administration and the police’s handling of the recent unrest, with some threatening industrial action if their demands are not met by mid-August. Civil servants from at least 44 departments, including non-frontline officers from the police force, the justice department and judiciary, issued two petitions. In the first, issued on Wednesday, more than 400 executive officers (EO) from over 30 departments were critical of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor for refusing to set up an independent inquiry into clashes into past weeks. They also condemned the “slow police response” to a violent mob attack in Yuen Long last Sunday. In a second statement, on Thursday, more than 230 civil servants also expressed frustrations. “If the government continues to ignore public opinion, we will organise concrete industrial actions, so we can humbly join hands with the community at large and fulfil our responsibility as servants of our fellow citizens,” the statement read, with photos of their staff cards attached. Apart from written petitions, dozens of messages echoing similar calls were posted on a “Lennon Wall” in the office of Policy Innovation and Coordination Office (Pico), a strategic department directly reporting to Lam. However, the heads of five disciplined forces – immigration, customs, fire, correctional and flying services – pledged in a joint declaration they would stand united to provide “unwavering support” to the embattled chief executive, while 19 associations representing staff and retirees of disciplinary forces appealed to their members to stand fast. “We also hope Hong Kong can get back on a normal course as soon as possible to remain a safe and liveable city,” the associations’ statement read. Three pro-establishment government staff groups also urged civil servants to stay politically neutral. The backlash from within the government came after a mob of white-clad men indiscriminately attacked protesters and passengers at a railway station in the northern town of Yuen Long on Sunday. It also prompted staff from Pico, a brainchild of Lam, to post Post-it notes with messages on the display boards, replicating the so-called Lennon Walls that have sprung up around the city. “After the Yuen Long incident we are all very shocked,” said a young Pico staff member. Pico was part of Lam’s election manifesto to replace the Central Policy Unit think tank, and to reach out to the city’s youth and involve them in policymaking. The office had recruited 20 young members as researchers. Civil servants said they were angry about the government’s lack of response after weeks of protests. A veteran employee in the police’s internal support section, who identified herself as Enoch Chan, said it was shameful for police to claim they did not have enough resources nor intelligence to stop the Yuen Long brawl. Another EO, who called herself Tina Lau, said the government must launch an independent inquiry into the clashes or she would consider work by rule or even striking. “I hope this can put pressure on the top officials, that civil servants do not blindly follow the government,” she said. Joshua Law Chi-kong, the secretary for the civil service, said he appreciated the desire of the staff to express their views over recent events. “I call on colleagues to continue to maintain professionalism and stand fast at this difficult time, to exercise their duty and serve the citizens,” Law said in a Facebook post. The Government Executive Grade Association, which represents 3,000 EOs, urged the government to take the lead to resolve the current deadlock, but said it did not notice any sign of escalation from EOs Dennis Ho Chun-pong, chairman of Fire Services Officers Association, said he did not notice any colleagues or association members posting their staff cards online to express political views. “It’s understandable for staff to have individual opinions but this may not be an ideal way to express them,” Ho said. Ho said the recent controversies surrounding police had “more or less” added pressure on the fire services. “But we are used to pressure as an emergency relief force,” he said. “Citizens are our first priority.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019979/hong-kong-civil-servants-set-lennon-wall-policy-innovation
Hong Kong mall operator Sun Hung Kai Properties to hire extra security and train staff ahead of Saturday protests in Yuen Long after earlier mob violence,"SHKP has taken unprecedented arrangement after armed mobs infiltrated MTR station through its Yoho Mall on Sunday; The city’s largest property developer also owns New Town Plaza in Sha Tin, which was the scene of clashes between police and protesters on July 14","8:00am, 25 Jul, 2019","The organiser of a potentially chaotic protest march planned for Saturday in Hong Kong’s northern town of Yuen Long has vowed to push on even though it would be an illegal assembly after police banned the gathering, citing a serious risk of violence.","Hong Kong’s largest property developer is hiring extra security guards, training its staff and setting up “safe spaces” in its shopping malls ahead of the protests in Yuen Long on Saturday, as it fears there could be more violence. The unprecedented arrangement by Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), the biggest private owner and operator of shopping malls in the city, came days after the horrifying attacks in Yuen Long MTR station where dozens of white-clad men indiscriminately assaulted commuters and protesters returning home from a massive march against the now-suspended extradition bill. The men with sticks and metal rods were seen entering the station through the adjacent Yoho Mall owned by SHKP on Sunday night, and subsequently attacking civilians in the station and the shopping centre. It was the second time SHKP had been caught in the middle of extradition bill protests in recent weeks, after the New Town Plaza shopping centre in Sha Tin, which it owns, became a battlefield between police officers and protesters on July 14. With another major protest expected in Yuen Long this Saturday against the vicious attacks, SHKP management said they are pulling out all the stops to bolster security. “We have invited a professional consultancy firm to provide extra training to our frontline staff of different levels and roles so they can better cope with emergency incidents,” a SHKP spokesman said on Wednesday. Security guards from properties in other districts would also be assigned to Yuen Long, he said, while refusing to disclose the exact number to be deployed. “It would be definitely higher than the 50 guards we have in Sha Tin,” he added. Some areas in the shopping centre would be set aside as ‘safety zones’ for civilians and tenants if things really get out of control, according to SHKP. The developer is also going to establish an early-warning system. It will have a team of people monitoring the protest outside and alert tenants of the latest situation through text messages. They will evaluate the risks and send warnings if there is an escalation. The management said the messages would also be broadcast to commuters and shoppers in the shopping centre via loudspeakers and TV screens. The property developer said it would issue updates and clarify rumours through the mall’s Facebook page. Signs showing emergency exits had also been placed in the lobby of the Yoho Midtown residential block, which is above the mall, on Wednesday. SHKP courted controversy after it was blamed for allowing police to enter New Town Plaza to clear protesters on July 14, which resulted in at least 28 injuries following hours of running battles. Angry residents had since staged nights of protests at the Sha Tin shopping centre, which included besieging the customer service desk. The developer on Tuesday stressed it was not working with police, but said it would have to call them in if there was any crime committed on its properties. It will also ask security staff and employees to wear staff cards and uniform to clearly identify themselves, after some guards were mistaken for plain-clothes police officers and surrounded by protesters during the clashes in Sha Tin.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019959/hong-kong-mall-operator-sun-hung-kai-properties-hire-extra
Will China send in the troops to stamp out protests in Hong Kong?,"Fears are growing in the city that the military could be called in to quell unrest; But the costs and complexities of doing so mean Beijing is highly unlikely to give the orders, observers say","11:30pm, 24 Jul, 2019","The organiser of a potentially chaotic protest march planned for Saturday in Hong Kong’s northern town of Yuen Long has vowed to push on even though it would be an illegal assembly after police banned the gathering, citing a serious risk of violence.","It is a prospect dreaded by many in Hong Kong, but debate is growing in mainland China about whether the central government should end weeks of upheaval in the city by sending in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA has had a presence in Hong Kong since the city’s return to Chinese sovereignty but – unlike in mainland China – memories of the military’s bloody suppression of pro-democracy students and activists in Beijing in 1989 are still strong in the city three decades on. Still, images of protesters vandalising Beijing’s liaison office in downtown Hong Kong on Sunday have fanned nationalist anger across the mainland, prompting calls for PLA intervention. Concerns only deepened on Wednesday when defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian commented on the recent clashes and protests in Hong Kong. Without suggesting any action or plans by the PLA, Wu made clear that the Garrison Law, which governs the operations of PLA troops in Hong Kong, already stipulates that the PLA is legally allowed to help the city maintain law and order at the request of Hong Kong’s government. “We are closely following the developments in Hong Kong, especially the violent attack against the central government’s liaison office by radicals on July 21,” Wu said. “Some behaviour of the radical protesters is challenging the authority of the central government and the bottom line of ‘one country, two systems’,” he warned, referring to the formula that grants Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. “This is intolerable.” Both Article 14 and Article 18 of the Basic Law – the city’s mini-constitution – spell out how and under what circumstances the PLA troops in Hong Kong can be used. While the legality is clear, analysts still believe that given the exorbitant political cost and complexities involved, using the military would remain an unlikely last resort. Even Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China’s nationalist tabloid Global Times, has spoken out against the idea, citing its “huge political cost” and the “severe uncertainty” it might bring to the situation. “Once the PLA has taken charge of the situation in Hong Kong and quelled the riots, what’s next?” Hu said in a social media post on Monday. Hu said there were no governance procedures in place that would allow the PLA to operate in Hong Kong and return things to normal. He also warned that any such action would be followed by international condemnation and a severe backlash among the Hong Kong public. “The [PLA’s] Hong Kong garrison is the symbol of national sovereignty. It is not a fire brigade for law and order in Hong Kong,” he said. The South China Morning Post reported last week that military force was not an option for mainland leaders working on a strategy to resolve the city’s biggest political crisis in decades. And in June Major General Chen Daoxiang, commander of the Hong Kong garrison, assured David Helvey, US principal deputy assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific security affairs, that Chinese troops would not interfere in the city’s affairs, according to Reuters. The comments support analysts’ assessments that deploying the PLA is not a viable solution to Hong Kong’s crisis. “Will the mobilisation of PLA troops further inflame the situation? There might be people who will resist or even revolt against the PLA, and that may lead to bloodshed,” said Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank. The last time Beijing sent in troops to quell pro-democracy protests was during the Tiananmen Square crackdown on June 4, 1989 – bloodshed that has stained the PLA and the Communist Party to this day, despite decades of efforts to wipe it from public memory. “Although they don’t like to admit it, they know they made a mistake in the way they used the PLA [in 1989],” said Larry Wortzel, a long-time PLA watcher, who witnessed the crackdown as an assistant military attache at the US embassy in Beijing 30 years ago. “In subsequent years, when there were major demonstrations, they managed to handle them with either the People’s Armed Police [PAP] or the Public Security Bureau [PSB], or in some cases a combination of both,” said Wortzel, now a senior fellow in Asian security at the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington. The PAP is a 1.5 million-strong paramilitary police force tasked with maintaining domestic security and order, while the PSB is the country’s police force. The June 4 crackdown is still widely remembered in Hong Kong, where tens of thousands gather every year on its anniversary for a candlelight vigil in the heart of the city. “The activities in Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party’s conduct there have really had a profound impact on thinking in Taiwan. It has killed any chance with any political party of [supporting] the one country, two systems,” Wortzel said. “The last thing President Xi Jinping and the Politburo Standing Committee would want to do, if they can avoid it, is to use the PLA [in Hong Kong].” The situation in Hong Kong is also being closely watched in the West, with many international firms basing regional headquarters in the Asian financial hub, thanks to its capitalist system and rule of law. Deploying the PLA to Hong Kong would certainly spark an international outcry and draw huge pressure from Western countries, said Liang Yunxiang, an international affairs expert at Peking University. “Britain, of course, would have the harshest criticism since it governed Hong Kong for a long time and signed treaties with China to ensure Beijing would keep its commitment to one country, two systems,” Liang said. In the United States, the repercussions could go beyond verbal condemnation to a shift in policy that might fundamentally change Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and prompt an exodus of businesses, according to Wortzel. “Any move to use the Chinese troops will create a furore in the US Congress … They will re-examine the Hong Kong Policy Act very carefully,” he said, referring to the bill passed in 1992 that allows Hong Kong to be treated as a non-sovereign entity distinct from mainland China on trade and economic matters. “They will simply treat Hong Kong like another Chinese city, which affects export controls and how the financial industry operates.” Just last month, members of Congress reintroduced the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. If the legislation is passed, the US could revoke Hong Kong’s special status under American law if Beijing fails to ensure the city has “sufficient autonomy”. The crisis comes as Beijing’s ties with Washington are already strained by a year-long trade war that has spilled into other areas of bilateral relations. There is also mounting international pressure on China over issues such as its mass internment and political indoctrination of an estimated million or more members of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, despite the Chinese government’s repeated denials of ill-treatment of the inmates and attempts to defend its policies. Chen Daoyin, a Shanghai-based political analyst, said the increasing scrutiny China faced from Western countries – whether in the form of punitive tariffs or restrictions on technology – made it all the more important for China to keep Hong Kong as an open channel to connect with the world. “If the military was deployed [in Hong Kong], it would mean China was ready to shut its doors completely,” Chen said. Lau, from the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the PLA should only be deployed as a last resort. “It would be a huge blow to the principle of ‘letting Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy’, since it will prove that Hong Kong people are not up to the task of governing themselves,” he said. Hu, from Global Times, said the PLA troops could be used only if the authorities lost control of the city or an armed rebellion broke out. Short of that, he said, the central government should let the chaos in Hong Kong run its course and wait for the public mood to flip. This strategy of sitting it out hinges on the city’s police force holding the line and stopping Hong Kong’s slide into total anarchy. Wortzel also warned that there were lines protesters should not cross – or risk provoking the use of military force. “For instance, to this point, demonstrators have not gone up against the PLA garrison or any of its outposts. If they did that, I think it’s possible – actually it is very likely – that there will be a limited mobilised response [to defend the facilities],” he said. While most analysts said the chance of Beijing resorting to military force was slim, the very idea – ludicrous to even discuss three months ago – has become a popular topic on social media on the mainland, where the discussion is not censored and many commenters support it. The official media have been careful not to touch the subject but they too have stepped up rhetoric against the protests in Hong Kong. In a rare move, state-run China Central Television has run commentaries and reports about protests in Hong Kong during its main evening news for five days in a row. Only the most politically important issues receive such unusual treatment.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3019960/will-china-send-troops-stamp-out-protests-hong-kong
Police unlikely to give green light to Saturday’s anti-government protest in Yuen Long over fears of recurrence of violence,"Source says police will likely refuse to grant letter of no objection for rally, which is planned to end at site of mob attacks on protesters and commuters; Organisers say rally will be peaceful but district councillors fear outbreak of violence while rural groups oppose application","10:10pm, 24 Jul, 2019","Asked about Ireland’s move, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing that Hongkongers would be saddened by it.","Police are unlikely to allow an anti-government protest in Hong Kong’s tension-filled northern town of Yuen Long on Saturday, according to law enforcement sources, with local community leaders worried about a serious risk of violence. “In light of the bloody clashes on Sunday night and especially over the past few weeks since June 12, we attach great importance to public safety while considering whether to approve a protest in Yuen Long,” one police insider said. “But we are likely to reject the application for a letter of no objection for Saturday’s rally. If we indeed come to such a conclusion, the organiser can still appeal the decision.” Yuen Long has become a flashpoint after a mob of men in white T-shirts, some of whom were suspected to be triad gangsters, went on a rampage at the MTR station on Sunday, attacking protesters and passengers alike and leaving 45 injured. Police arrested another suspect on Wednesday, raising the total number of those detained to 12. Protest organiser and Yuen Long resident Chung Kin-ping said his meeting with police on Wednesday for a letter of no objection had ended in disagreement, but he vowed to push ahead with the short march from near the police station to the railway station. “What happened in Yuen Long on July 21 was a terrorist attack and it has aroused widespread concern,” Chung said. “I hope people can stand up and come out to free us from fear.” He said he advocated a “peaceful, rational and non-violent” protest, but could not give a guarantee. “We can’t control what different people will do afterwards. To be honest, I’m worried,” he said. In a letter circulated online, Yuen Long district councillor Ching Chan-ming, who also chairs the Shap Pat Heung Rural Committee, informed Yuen Long’s police commander that his group would strongly object if the march were allowed to go ahead. “It’s already been widely circulated on the internet that some people will attack Nam Pin Wai village that night … If police still issue a letter of no objection, they need to be held responsible for all serious consequences,” the letter read. He was referring to calls online for protesters to target the village said to be home to some attackers and to damage their ancestral halls as revenge. Ching also accused the organiser of being a pro-independence activist, which Chung denied. Leading developer Sun Hung Kai Properties was planning to step up safety measures in its malls near the railway station this weekend, while 13 members of the Yuen Long District Council issued a joint statement calling on villagers and protesters to exercise self-restraint. “The district council members are extremely worried about an outbreak of violence this Saturday,” chairman Shum Ho-kit said. Anger over the Yuen Long rampage was directed at the city’s train operator on Wednesday morning, with a handful of protesters causing rush-hour chaos by stopping a train from leaving Admiralty station. That had a knock-on impact on North Point station, bringing services to a halt at the interchange for the Tseung Kwan O and Island lines. While condemning police for arriving far too late to protect the victims of the Yuen Long attacks, protesters were demanding the MTR take responsibility for their safety as well. A similar demonstration was in the pipeline for Thursday morning at Kowloon Tong station. For the first time in the protest crisis, the heads of all the city’s disciplinary services, including the immigration, customs and fire departments, issued a joint statement strongly condemning the recent outbreaks of violence. “The disciplinary forces will stay united to keep up their commitment, continue to do their utmost in upholding the rule of law and give unswerving support to the chief executive,” they said. The civil unrest over the past weeks has prompted the United States, Britain, Japan and South Korea to issue travel advice to their nationals about being careful in Hong Kong, while Ireland urged a “high degree of caution” for its citizens. Pro-democracy group and major anti-government rally organiser the Civil Human Rights Front is also urging foreign consulates to issue travel warnings for the city in light of the Yuen Long rampage. “All people … who really love Hong Kong should unite to safeguard the city’s security and order. Let Hong Kong, the Pearl of the Orient, shine once again,” she said. More anti-government protests are expected, including two marches ending at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park in Western District the coming Sunday and the next. The park is about 1km (0.6 miles) away from Beijing’s liaison office, which was besieged on July 21 by protesters who defaced the national emblem on the building front. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Hong Kong Bar Association renewed its call for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to carefully examine the administration of the police force in the past few weeks, given complaints about brutality against protesters. MTR Corp chairman Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce have also urged Lam to heed the calls for an independent inquiry into the facts surrounding the protest crisis triggered by the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China. But Chinese Manufacturers’ Association president Dennis Ng Wang-pun said any inquiry should focus on the government’s deficiencies, and not on the police force itself.

‘The whole car smelled of blood’: Hong Kong victims describe brutal attack at Yuen Long MTR station; some may sue for damages,"Six Hongkongers come forward with details of violent attack by angry mob of men in white T-shirts, one asking: ‘Where was the law?’; Another witness says: ‘We were just passengers, normal citizens, on the way back home’","8:16pm, 24 Jul, 2019","All six of the Hongkongers who came forward on Wednesday said they were shaken by the brutal assault on Sunday night, which was purportedly aimed at black-clad protesters after an extradition bill rally but also injured regular passengers. Of the victims, aged between 14 and 58, only one said he had attended the day’s protest.; The MTR Corporation later said it called police about the violence at the station at 10.47pm. Officers arrived at around 11.20pm, according to witnesses, after the white-clad mob had left the scene.; Police, in response, said the emergency hotline was overwhelmed with calls and officers were spread thin dealing with fights in different areas.; Ma said the right to public assembly is protected by law in Hong Kong and he would seek damages from the MTR Corp. He said he hoped the rail operator press police to explain its actions on Sunday.","Victims of the attack at Yuen Long MTR station said they were left alone to fight off a white-clad mob wielding sticks and metals rods, and some might seek damages for their injuries – from the assailants, the city’s railway operator and the police. The youngest of the group, a secondary school pupil surnamed Kwok, was heading home with his father on the West Rail Line after they had visited a friend in Ma Wan. When the train stopped at Yuen Long station at 10.40pm, people rushed into the carriage and screamed for help. The panicked group said some people were bleeding from the beatings. At least 45 people were sent or sought treatment at hospitals, according to the Hospital Authority. “Then the people in white came to beat us with wooden sticks and baseball bats,” Kwok said. “It is lucky that I stood in the back and did not get hit.” Some 30 minutes later, the train finally moved on from Yuen Long station. “The floor was bloody, there were many broken umbrellas and sticks. It was chaos,” Kwok said. “Where was the law?” “I no longer believe them,” said Kwok, when asked if he would seek help from police in the future. Kwok’s father, a 58-year-old driver, called the men in white T-shirts “terrorists”. He said there were no police on hand to stop them during what he described as a “life-and-death” situation. The father said he was angry with comments by the pro-establishment camp that protesters were heading to Yuen Long that night. “We were just passengers, normal citizens, on the way back home,” he said. He added that he was thinking about suing police and the MTR Corp for emotional distress. Two of the six, all of whom contacted the Democratic Party, were physically injured during the Sunday night attack. A 48-year-old man, surnamed Ma, still had a large bruise on his right arm and marks left by wooden sticks on his upper body. Ma was the only person in the group who attended the march on Hong Kong Island and was dressed in black when he arrived in Yuen Long station at 10.50pm. “The white-clad people hit me with sticks, on my head, my torso and arms,” Ma said, displaying swollen knuckles from protecting his head. “I had to be beaten for attending a march?” Ma said. Another injured passenger, surnamed Leung, 32, said he was on his way to Yuen Long to meet friends. After being warned inside the station, Leung swapped his black T-shirt for a white one, but was targeted nonetheless. While trying to help a person who had tripped, Leung said he was hit in the back of his head and was chased by the mob into the train. “Some people begged for mercy, some were crying, some girls were bleeding from their heads,” Leung said. “The whole car smelled of blood.” The attack lasted more than 30 minutes without police intervention. Leung said many passengers tried to call the 999 police hotline. “When I was being beaten, all I could do was look to see if police were coming – but they didn’t come.” Leung said when he finally went home to Tuen Mun and called 999 for an ambulance, seven police officers showed up with the emergency vehicle. Ma and Leung, who both filed police reports, said no one from the force had contacted them for statements. A man and woman said they tried to reach the train captain through the intercom and by banging on the driver compartment’s door, but got no response. The woman, surnamed Hui, said she was on her way home from a meal in Tsuen Wan and was dressed in black. Hui said passengers had to defend themselves and tried to disguise anyone in black. She also said there were no MTR workers or police to help them. “We had to save ourselves, no one was there to save us,” Hui said. The MTR Corp said it tried to arrange trains to pick up trapped passengers in Yuen Long station, but it was not possible because some trains were stranded at the station with their doors blocked from closing. Late on Wednesday, operations director Adi Lau Tin-shing said that staff had called police by a direct line when they noticed something was going on in the station lobby, and that officers paid a brief visit to the site. Lau said there were only four workers at the station at the time, insisting they were closely following standard procedures. He noted that asking passengers to leave the train was part of procedures, which stipulated that carriages had to be cleared if the doors fail to close after a period of time. “At the time, there was no fighting on the lobby or the platform,” he said, adding that the clashes only took place minutes after passengers were asked to leave. Lam Cheuk-ting, a Democratic Party lawmaker who was attacked at Yuen Long station, required 18 stitches for a wound on his face. Lam said that his party would help anyone seeking damages for the attack, and that he was considering it himself.

Hong Kong and mainland China students clash at rally at Australian university,Pro-democracy students staged a sit-in supporting the anti-extradition protests in Hong Kong; Mainland students singing the Chinese national anthem allegedly attacked the pro-democracy protesters,"3:00pm, 24 Jul, 2019","Students from Hong Kong and mainland China clashed during a pro-democracy protest at a university in Australia on Wednesday.; Scuffles broke out between opposing groups at the University of Queensland in Brisbane after pro-democracy students staged a sit-in supporting the extradition bill protests in Hong Kong and also condemning China’s treatment of Uygurs in Xinjiang.; At the University of Queensland in Australia, Hong Kong students were attacked by Chinese during the ""#antiELAB""event.#LiberateHK@washingtonpost @CBSNews @cnni @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @PressSec @SpeakerPelosi @RepMcGovern @marcorubio @VOAChinese @SecPompeo @RFI @VP pic.twitter.com/xPQ6UWdjD0; — Snow Fang (@Snow_Fang2) July 24, 2019; “China has absolute respect for Xinjiang and Hong Kong in terms of politics and human rights,” said a signatory named Flora Zhang.; Fears of Chinese influence, including the monitoring and direction of international students by embassies and consulates, led Canberra to pass sweeping anti-foreign interference laws last year that strained relations with Beijing.; Several weeks later, Chinese students in South Korea hurled rocks and other objects at demonstrators during the relay as they protested Beijing’s treatment of North Korean refugees.; Connect with us on Twitter and Facebook .","Student activist Tony Chang said mainland students singing the Chinese national anthem attacked the pro-democracy protesters without provocation. “They robbed our loudspeaker, and also some of our slogans, and even tore our slogans,” he said, adding that mainland students had punched a number of pro-Hong Kong protesters in the face. Richard Murray, a journalism lecturer at the university, said he saw punches thrown between several students before campus security intervened. Up to 40 police officers arrived on the scene to keep the groups apart but no arrests appeared to have been made, he said. Murray said up to 1,000 students had gathered at the scene, most of them mainland Chinese. An internet petition condemning the pro-democracy protest had attracted more than 1,100 signatories by late afternoon. “I came to this country for education, peace, and the careful community environment,” said a student named Keira Gao, who started the petition. “However, today’s protest unveiled the other facet of this school, which I felt strong discomfort [about].” “Hong Kong is a part of China!” said another signatory calling himself Dawen Si. The University of Queensland said campus security called police to the scene. “One of the roles of universities is to enable open, respectful and lawful free speech, including debate about ideas we may not all support or agree with,” the university said in a statement. “The university expects staff and students to express their views in a lawful and respectful manner … Earlier today, in response to safety concerns resulting from a student-initiated protest on campus, the university requested police support. “On the advice of police, protesters were requested to move on. The safety of all students is paramount to the university.” Last month, the University of Queensland’s student union voted in support of pro-democracy protesters in the city and to condemn the “Hong Kong and Chinese governments for their subversion of democratic rights and freedoms in both Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China”. Ian Hall, an international relations professor at the Griffith Asia Institute in Brisbane, said that such clashes were likely to become more common, but that Australian universities were “woefully unprepared” to deal with them. “They are partly to blame too, because they have allowed Chinese student associations on campuses to be funded and controlled by the People’s Republic of China embassy and consulates,” Hall said. “This has allowed PRC diplomats to monitor students, to intimidate them, if necessary, and to orchestrate shows of strength or support for the PRC.” In 2008, Chinese students scuffled with pro-Tibet activists in Canberra as the Olympic torch passed through the Australian capital. There were about 175,000 Chinese studying in Australia last year, according to the Department of Education. About 9,244 Hongkongers chose the country for study in 2013, according to the ICEF Monitor, which covers the international education industry.",https://scmp.com/print/news/asia/australasia/article/3019888/hong-kong-and-mainland-china-students-clash-rally-australian
Hong Kong protest organiser worried about risk of further violence at coming march in Yuen Long against gang attacks,Activists planning to march in Yuen Long on Saturday to protest vicious attacks that left at least 45 people injured; Lawmaker Junius Ho doubles down in row with Eddie Chu telling him to choose next steps carefully,"1:07pm, 24 Jul, 2019","Chung Kin-ping, a Yuen Long resident who is organising the demonstration in response to Sunday’s brutal attack in the town’s MTR station, said in radio programmes on Wednesday he advocated a “peaceful, rational and non-violent” protest, but was worried it could get out of control.","The organiser of Saturday’s planned march in a tense northern Hong Kong town has admitted he is worried about potential clashes between protesters and gangsters that would lead to a repeat of recent violence which has gripped the community. “After the protest, we will organise an assembly under the Yuen Long MTR station. Anyone can take part. We can’t control what different people would do afterwards,” Chung said. “To be honest, I’m worried.” His comments came after legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu doubled down in his dispute with pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick over the matter, telling him in a Facebook live post to choose between the paths of life or death. Ho had earlier roused the anger of protesters by shaking hands with men in white T-shirts on the night of the unprecedented violence, when passengers, passers-by, and anti-government protesters returning from a rally in Causeway Bay were attacked by 100 men wielding sticks and iron rods. In response to Sunday night’s violence at the station, which left 45 people injured, angry social media activists called for a protest to be held this weekend, and demand an independent inquiry be set up to investigate the attack. Police suspect the attack was carried out because of differences in political views. To the anger of some rural villagers in Yuen Long, some other residents have set up “Lennon Walls” to show their disapproval over the government’s now-suspended extradition bill. The legislation, if passed, would have allowed fugitives in Hong Kong to be transferred to places the city does not have extradition agreements with, including mainland China. Officers have been criticised by those who believe they were slow to respond to the incident. As of Thursday night, 11 people had been arrested, and sources said 10 other attackers had already fled the city. Chung was still in talks with police over details of the protest, including its route. But so far organisers planned to start near the Yuen Long police station and end about 1.4km away at the MTR station. About 100 marshals would be used to maintain order, Chung said. A potential flashpoint between protesters and villagers could be where the protest is expected to finish, which is close to a village there. On this, Chung said 10 marshals would stand between the end and the village to try to minimise conflict. Pro-Beijing lawmaker and rural leader, Leung Che-cheung, told protesters in a radio programme not to come to Yuen Long this weekend, as he feared what was planned to be a peaceful protest could turn violent, as had happened in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the Civil Human Rights Front has called on foreign consulates in Hong Kong to issue a travel alert for the city in light of the violent brawl in Yuen Long, and to press the government to protect foreign nationals living there. In an open letter issued to diplomats from 61 countries, the pro-democracy group said the clash was no different to a “terrorists attack”. It added that city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor should bear the sole responsibility for the unrest for not responding to demands from protesters, and called for universal suffrage. “When Carrie Lam’s government continues to ignore the Hong Kong people’s legitimate demands, including a request to set up an independent inquiry, discontent will only be built up to a boiling point, and the social situation aggravated,” the front wrote. “Therefore, CHRF urges you to officially request the HKSAR Government to promise to protect your citizens’ personal and property safety, and to issue an outbound travel alert to prevent them from being victims of violence of mobs and the Hong Kong Police Force.” In a separate development, internet users are planning two marches ending at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park in the Western District on the next two Sundays. The park is about 1km away from Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong, which was besieged on July 21 by protesters, with some defacing its national emblem with black paintballs. The march this Sunday will be from Chater Garden in Central to the park. It seeks to decry police’s firing of tear gas and rubber bullets in a clash with protesters in Sheung Wan on July 21. On August 4, protesters will march from Forbes Street Temporary Playground in Kennedy Town to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park. Organisers of that rally said they would invite Ho to join them so he could “have a dialogue with young people”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019869/hong-kong-protest-organiser-worried-about-risk-further
Hong Kong town of Yuen Long haunted by black and white colours of protesters and gangs amid extradition bill crisis,"Some feel judged or targeted for wearing black while others still tormented by images of white-clad mob beating up commuters; Tensions continue in a city already rocked by weeks of protests, with calls to recognise problem as a breakdown in system and policy","12:00pm, 24 Jul, 2019",Yuen Long resident Nicole Chan Hei-man was at home and glued to the television set as news of the horrifying attacks at an MTR station in her neighbourhood unfolded on Sunday.,"She has since suffered from insomnia, haunted by the harrowing images of white-clad men with sticks and metal rods beating up commuters indiscriminately. The housewife, 36, said she was furious at the mob and frustrated with police’s seeming inaction, while worrying for her son, aged three. “I will avoid going out with him at night,” Chan said. “What will happen if we are on the train and people start beating others up? Will my son be traumatised for the rest of his life?” Chan is among residents of the town in the New Territories still anxious over the unprecedented violence that erupted on Sunday night, as masked men in white stormed Yuen Long station, appearing to target protesters returning from the city centre who had earlier marched against the now-suspended extradition bill. In the chaos that ensued, the mob also attacked other commuters, especially those in black, the theme colour of demonstrators. The city’s embattled police force has come under fire for not responding in a timely fashion. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Hong Kong Red Cross had received at least 23 calls through its psychological support hotline from people who felt “frightened, angry, concerned and sad” about the attack. “There is no way out. Protesting is useless. Calling police is useless,” Chan said. “All I can do is avoid going out. My child’s safety is of utmost importance.” On Tuesday evening, Steven Wong, a 56-year-old company director who does not live in Yuen Long but grew up there, went to the railway station with an umbrella and helmet. He wanted to see the place he still has emotional ties with, but brought along gear in preparation for any violence. “[The white-clad men] were creating terror and trying to force people to step back – but stepping back will only encourage them,” he said. “I grew up in Yuen Long and I understand the place very well.” In the aftermath of the bloody attacks in which at least 45 people were injured and 11 have been arrested, the colour of one’s clothes has become a sensitive issue, with white associated with triads thought to be behind the incident, and black for extradition bill protesters. Student Ryan Mickey Lee, 19, said he felt people were judging him for wearing black, especially in the New Territories. “When I wear black, I can feel some elderly people staring at me thinking that I am one of those whom, as they say, disrupted society,” he said. “I will just ignore their glares – if we do not stand up to protect our future now, what will happen to us?” Chan said she did think about not dressing her son in black, but added: “You can’t just judge a person by the colour they wear.” Sunday’s attacks in Yuen Long were the latest escalation in what has been weeks of protests against the hated extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no such agreement. Protesters want the bill completely withdrawn, among other demands. A major march that day ended in clashes with police, who used tear gas in the heart of the city. The late-night violence that followed in Yuen Long only further deepened rifts in society, heightening tensions in social circles. Chan said she would avoid discussing the topic with family members, who held different political views. “For some people, you just can’t discuss this with them,” she said. Wong also said he had different political views from his wife, who was content as long as they had a roof over their heads. But over the years she slowly accepted his views too and they rarely enter into debates on their stances. Education University sociology lecturer Dr Minnie Li Ming said the ongoing movement had not only widened rifts between the young and elderly, but also between local and mainland Chinese students. On Tuesday night, a mainland alumni of the City University was arrested for tearing down anti-bill posters and memos from the “democracy wall” in the campus, and pushing a democracy goddess statue to the floor. Li said other mainland Chinese students found themselves sandwiched between rival camps even if they supported the cause of their local peers, as those back home disagreed with them while their schoolmates did not trust them. The lecturer said for Hong Kong to move forward, people should recognise the divisions in society stemmed from inadequate systems and policies, and dialogue on equal footing was needed. “That’s what a democracy is all about,” she said. Meanwhile, Lee and Wong, both Yuen Long natives from different generations, pledged to join the coming protest planned for the area. “I hope everyone, even though we may not achieve much, will come out and voice their opinions. Yuen Long is part of Hong Kong after all. It’s better than doing nothing,” Lee said.

Two calls per second ‘jammed emergency lines’ during violence in Hong Kong’s Yuen Long,"Police insiders say there was no way operators could deal with deluge of calls during attack on subway station, saying some people crowded the line deliberately; Officers also hit out at claims of collusion with perpetrators","11:13am, 24 Jul, 2019",Yuen Long resident Nicole Chan Hei-man was at home and glued to the television set as news of the horrifying attacks at an MTR station in her neighbourhood unfolded on Sunday.,"An emergency services hotline in northern Hong Kong was jammed by 24,000 calls in three hours on Sunday night, a senior police officer revealed on Tuesday after the force came under fire for its slow response to the violent attacks at a subway station. The Post has learned that there were only 10 operators to handle the calls made between 10.30pm and 1.30am – which came in at an average rate of two per second, meaning they would each have had to deal with a call every five seconds to take them all. The centre usually handles an average of 2,500 calls a day. Superintendent Lau Siu-pong said in a video posted on the force’s Facebook page on Tuesday that many calls were not answered as a lot of people tried report the attacks inside Yuen Long MTR station from about 10.45pm, especially after online appeals for people to call the line, some – police said – intending to jam it. “This is totally impossible. And that explains the jamming of the line,” a police insider said. “People online also advocated that people call 999 to jam the line. So it was not us who did not want to pick up calls. As a matter of fact, we couldn’t.” Police were also criticised for taking 35 minutes to send officers to the station, where about 100 armed, white-clad men attacked extradition bill protesters and other passengers. The attackers had fled by the time officers arrived at 11.20pm, leaving 45 people injured. About 40 minutes later, a confrontation between more than 400 people from both sides broke out in a nearby village. As all officers in the Yuen Long police district were busy dealing with fights and assaults in different areas, a squad of more than 500 officers who were dispersing anti-government protesters in Sheung Wan at the time was redeployed to Yuen Long to handle the chaos, another police source said. By the time the squad arrived, most of the men in white shirts had left. The team, which came on duty at 9am on Sunday, stayed at the village’s entrance until 5am on Monday and retreated to the police headquarters at 7am, ending a 22-hour shift. Law enforcement sources said these snapshots of events on Sunday reflected the manpower constraints on the force while it has handled a series of extradition bill protests since early June, especially when protests turned violent. Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung pledged on Monday to review the deployments and response times. One of the sources said that while the force had 31,000 officers, management had mainly used the 3,000 riot police to handle the protests, which included marches that organisers estimated drew up to 2 million people. One officer said on condition of anonymity: “We were exhausted as we worked nearly 24 hours and had to wear full riot gear for more than 12 hours.” The officer said he felt helpless as it was unclear when the protests would end. The police insiders also slammed internet users and local media for publishing unverified videos and rumours that fuelled accusations of police collusion with triads in the Sunday attacks. One of the videos, published on Monday night, showed Pat Heung divisional commander Li Hon-man chatting with a group of men mostly dressed in white. One of them asked Li if the police had taken away the protesters. “We are in deep trouble if they [attack] us again! Otherwise we will scare them off!” he said, referring to the protesters who gathered in a Yuen Long park to watch recordings of police’s enforcement actions during the recent protests. In the same video, another man in the group showed pity for police officers injured during the bloody clashes at Sha Tin’s New Town Plaza on July 14. And Li replied: “Heartfelt, really. But your help would just make us even busier.” The police insider said the video clip did not mention that the conversation in Yuen Long took place not on Sunday, but on July 16. “Li did not even say anything wrong in the video. The uploader wanted to mix the two events together and let people believe we have connections with triads. They want to smear us apparently,” he said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019821/two-calls-second-jammed-emergency-lines-during-sunday

“Hongkongers love to work so much!” another remarked sarcastically. pic.twitter.com/FGamz7lvai; — Rachel Yeo (@racporter) July 24, 2019","Rush hour train services were disrupted and delayed in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning after anti-government protesters launched another campaign against rail operator the MTR Corporation. At 8.20am, protesters prevented a Chai Wan-bound train from leaving Admiralty station by obstructing the doors. The service finally left 18 minutes late. There were disputes among passengers, protesters and police, as crowds grew on platforms. “Your family members are getting beaten, how do you still have the mood to work?” protesters said. “Hongkongers love to work!” another remarked sarcastically. This was the second time this week train services were disrupted. Since Monday, protesters have demanded the MTR Corp be held accountable for failing to protect passengers during violent late-night attacks in Yuen Long on Sunday. About 100 men carrying metal rods beat up citizens and passengers, leaving at least 45 people injured. Eleven suspects have been arrested so far in connection with the incident. The protests at Admiralty caused North Point station, which serves as an interchange for the Tseung Kwan O and Island lines, to come to a standstill. Announcements made at the station advised travellers to find other modes of transport. Just after 9am, no trains had arrived at either platform, both of which were filled with morning commuters. Some travellers opted to leave the station, and the MTR Corp allowed Octopus card users to leave without paying. Outside the station long queues formed at tram and bus stops. Kenneth Ng, an accountant, who lives in Yau Tang and works in Admiralty opted to take a bus to his office instead. He estimated it would add 30 minutes to his journey. “It’s a bit of a hassle but I understand the protesters,” he said. “But my inconvenience is small in the grand scheme of things. “When our government doesn’t listen, we need non-cooperation actions like this.” Not everyone supported the protesters. Sunny Lai Tat, 40, a clerical officer, was taken aback by the disruption. “I didn’t even know this was happening, there’s just too much information going on,” he said. “I’m a little unhappy because I was supposed to meet somebody at 9.30am, but now I’m going to be late. “It’s affecting the public’s daily lives too much, so I suggest they shouldn’t do it at peak hours.” By around 9.30am train services were gradually returning to normal in Admiralty and North Point. As services resumed, the number of people waiting for buses and trams was significantly reduced. Earlier, hundreds of people had queued up for trams and buses, with lines extending into the road at the intersection between Shu Kuk Street and King’s Road. MTR operations director Adi Lau Tin-shing said 90 trains were delayed on Monday and 30 on Wednesday amid the emergence of a non-cooperative movement targeted at the rail operator. Lau said on normal days, around four to five trains were delayed on average. MTR Corp CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui said the firm respected the people’s will to express their opinions and it had tried its best to ensure train services run normally. “If they have any dissatisfaction, we will try to explain. When we have done something poorly, we will improve. We hope that dissatisfied residents will not obstruct the journeys of others.” Two war rooms to manage train operations have been planned for Saturday, when another protest is expected to take place. More staff would also be deployed.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019845/extradition-bill-protesters-cause-rush-hour-chaos-hong-kong

Arthur Shek Kang-chuen, associate publisher of the Hong Kong Economic Times and executive director of the newspaper group, had his resignation accepted by the company’s board on Tuesday with immediate effect. In a public notice, issued by the group chairman Lawrence Fung Siu-por, the company said Shek, who handed in his resignation on Monday, “wishes to pursue his other personal interests”. Shek will remain as a columnist of the newspaper group, according to the notice. “Mr Shek has confirmed that he has no disagreement with the board and there is no matter relating to his resignation which needs to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the company,” the notice said. The board thanked Shek for his “valuable contribution” to the company. The news of his resignation came three days after he attended a rally, titled “Safeguard Hong Kong”, organised by the pro-establishment camp to condemn violence during recent protests and show support for police. At the rally, he called for action against those violent extradition bill protesters, likening it to disciplining children. “You should say no to those masked, black-shirted men. They have weapons, umbrellas. We can’t use sticks. Do you have a cane at home? Get one, get a longer one,” Shek told the crowds during the rally, which the organisers claimed 316,000 people had joined, while police said there were 103,000 people. “What if you don’t have one at home? Go to a metalware shop, buy a 20mm [diameter] water pipe, and teach your son a lesson.” Among those attending the rally included former justice minister Elsie Leung Oi-sie, former police commissioner Tang King-shing, former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing, and prominent businessman Allan Zeman. But on Sunday night, as an anti-extradition bill protest march ended in violent clashes again on Hong Kong Island, a group of armed men unleashed ferocious attacks on commuters at the Yuen Long MTR station, sending 45 people to hospital. Some of the attackers allegedly used canes to beat people. It prompted a petition on Monday by Economic Times staff members against what they called Shek’s incitement of the Yuen Long attack. Shek later offered an apology and retracted his “cane” remarks. Current affairs observer Chan Wai-keung, a lecturer at Polytechnic University, said: “I think Shek just meant to use a metaphor. It is unfortunate that it sparked a controversy and he was forced to quit. I hope this will not lead to a chilling effect on free speech.” Nixie Lam Lam, a pro-government district councillor who also attended last Saturday’s rally, said she respected Shek for accepting accountability. Neither Shek nor a spokesman for the newspaper group could be reached for comment by the time of publication.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019828/veteran-press-executive-arthur-shek-resigns-after

“Hongkongers love to work so much!” another remarked sarcastically. pic.twitter.com/FGamz7lvai; — Rachel Yeo (@racporter) July 24, 2019","Anti-government protesters planning a mass rally in Hong Kong’s northern town of Yuen Long this weekend to condemn last Sunday’s vicious attacks on train passengers by a rampaging mob have been cautioned over the risk of further violence, with one pro-establishment lawmaker from the district warning of dire consequences if participants heed online calls to damage village properties. Saturday’s planned protest was already causing concern on Tuesday as two local residents submitted an application to police for the march to the site of the attacks. About 100 men in white T-shirts assaulted anyone they came across at the MTR station with sticks and metal rods, leaving 45 people injured. While it was business as usual in Yuen Long on Tuesday, after it was transformed into a ghost town the previous day, rumours were rife online about the possibility of further violence, contributing to an atmosphere of fear in anticipation of the weekend. The Education University and the University of Hong Kong offered to help students in need, including hostel accommodations, if they were afraid of returning home to Yuen Long. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said his bureau would also offer advice to schools in Yuen Long concerning their summer activities, with parents worried about their possible exposure to further violence. Police, who have been heavily criticised for turning up too late to stop Sunday night’s mayhem, arrested five more suspects on Tuesday, raising the total to 11. Police sources said that 10 of the attackers had fled the city. As public anger continued to boil over the attacks, there were calls online for a protest on Wednesday morning against the MTR, with many blaming the railway operator for failing to protect passengers that night. Some set up a Lennon Wall at a bus terminal under the Yuen Long MTR station, posting messages urging the railway company to bear responsibility and saying “no terrorism”. The fallout from the attacks also claimed an unlikely casualty on Tuesday – veteran journalist Arthur Shek Kang-chuen quit the Hong Kong Economic Times newspaper group he co-founded over remarks he made at a pro-government rally last weekend that protesters should be caned like undisciplined children. One of those planning the coming Saturday march, Tuen Mun resident Michael Mo Kwan-tai, said he had applied for approval to start near the Yuen Long police station and end about 1.4km away at the MTR station. Apart from the regular demands of the anti-extradition movement for a complete withdrawal of the bill that would allow the transfer of fugitives to mainland China and for an independent inquiry into complaints of police brutality, Mo said they were also seeking a full investigation into the Yuen Long rampage. Asked if he was worried about violence breaking out during the march, Mo promised it would be “peaceful, rational and non-violent”. Calls online to “take revenge” on rural powers allegedly behind the Sunday attacks have been causing particular concern. A list of targets, including the graves of the parents of rural leader and pro-government lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu and ancestral halls in rural communities, had been circulating online since Sunday. The tombstones of Ho’s parents were ultimately desecrated on Tuesday, prompting a firm condemnation from the lawmaker. Another pro-government lawmaker and rural leader, Leung Che-cheung, warned there would be dire consequences for those who entered villages and damaged properties. “Thousands of villagers will come after you, you will not make it out,” Leung said. Council Front lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick of the pro-democracy camp also urged protesters not to heed calls for revenge. “If you go mess with their historic buildings, you will only justify villagers’ calls to protect their community,” Chu said. Instead, Chu said, protesters should focus on making their demands clear and call for a probe into who orchestrated the Sunday attack.

The country urged their nationals to be careful about unexpected situations.; Earlier this week, the Hong Kong Tourism Board said the number of short-haul travellers to the city dwindled sharply at the beginning of this month, at 3.3 per cent between July 1 and July 5 year on year. Fewer travellers came from South Korea and Taiwan as well.","High-end hotels and business travellers in districts – such as Causeway Bay, Admiralty, Wan Chai and Central – were among the hardest-hit as roads were blocked and even shops were forced to down shutters temporarily for demonstrations that have lately been a regular affair almost every weekend. “There were a lot of major protests in July and this will affect the desire of tourists from short-haul locations – such as Japan, South Korea and Thailand – to come to Hong Kong,” Michael Li Hon-shing, executive director of the Federation of Hotel Owners, said on Tuesday. Hong Kong has been rocked by a wave of protests since early June against the bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city does not have such arrangements. Li said visitors from mainland China would get somewhat used to Hong Kong’s situation if it did not turn too violent. “For example, Guangdong travellers are mostly familiar with Hong Kong’s environment. There is a possibility that they would still come here.” He expressed concerns about a trade show scheduled in a month – the watch and clock fair, and said that some overseas exhibitors might skip the event. As the protests unfolded in early June, several consulates – such as those of the United States, Canada, Australia and Macau – issued travel advisories for their nationals when travelling to the city. They urged their citizens to avoid areas where demonstrations over the extradition bill were taking place and watch out for potential violence in public gatherings. The city’s total tourist arrivals overall grew 4.2 per cent for the same period, but it meant the lowest weekly growth since the middle of June. In the first five months of the year, Hong Kong hotels were on average 90 per cent full, or 1 percentage point higher than the same period last year, according to the board. This was despite the fact that the number of hotel rooms in the city grew 4 per cent during the period.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3019808/hong-kong-bracing-dip-hotel-occupancy-amid-series
Sales down at least 10 per cent at Hong Kong Book Fair 2019 as weekend protest against extradition bill halts traffic,"Exhibitors say business has been slow throughout the week, with event being less crowded than in previous years; The fair, one of the world’s largest, ends on Tuesday","7:34pm, 23 Jul, 2019","Hong Kong’s hotel occupancy for this month is expected to go down by 3 to 4 percentage points year on year amid the ongoing protests over the now-suspended extradition bill, a hotel owners’ group has warned.; Although Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor suspended the bill on June 15 and called it dead on July 9, protesters are still unhappy with her refusal to fully withdraw the legislation.

Fewer travellers came from South Korea and Taiwan as well.","Sales at the annual Hong Kong book fair were down by at least 10 per cent this year, some exhibitors said on Tuesday as extradition bill protests over the weekend brought traffic around the venue to a halt. Roads were closed on Sunday around the Hong Kong Book Fair 2019 – one of the world’s largest – at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, which is less than 1km from the government headquarters in Admiralty. Hundreds of thousands of people were estimated to have shown up for a third major march against the now-suspended extradition bill, with the protest ending in clashes as police fired tear gas, while closer to midnight violent attacks in Yuen Long led to some choosing to stay home the next day. Exhibitors said attendance for the week-long fair with 680 vendors had been mostly low. Some 980,000 visitors showed up – slightly down from last year’s 1 million, according to organiser Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The fair closes on Tuesday. A representative from Taiwanese publisher Book Republic said by 8pm on Sunday there were almost no customers left, even though the fair was open for another four hours until midnight. “I guess this year is special because of the extradition bill,” he said. Jimmy Pang Chi-ming, president of publisher Subculture, said: “Usually by 11am it would be impossible to get into the hall, but this year it’s still really easy to walk around.” Pang said sales of most of his books had dropped by about 10 per cent this year. “But we are the only publisher for a collection of artist Zunzi’s political comics over the past 40 years, and for political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu’s new book on the Tiananmen crackdown. “Sales of these books have been enough to cover our costs at the fair,” he said. Subculture has had booths at the event since its inception in 1990. “Interestingly, on Saturday during a pro-government protest, many mainland Chinese came to buy political books. I didn’t see them after that day,” Pang added. He said mainland customers had told him they heard about the books on a Hong Kong political radio show. Carol Lam Ming-lai, sales and marketing manager for Popular Hong Kong, said sales had dipped 15 per cent overall. “Two years ago when there was a typhoon, people were still crowding the place on the day the book fair reopened,” Lam said. “But this year it was quiet on Sunday and after 3pm on Monday. I think many people were afraid they would not be able to get home because of the rumours there would be trouble in Yuen Long. “We also had to make special arrangements to ensure our staff who live in the New Territories could get home safe.” Even though Popular mainly carries lifestyle books, Lam said two titles dealing with mental health were extremely popular. A Cup of Therapy, an illustrated book based on true stories of people by Finnish artist Matti Pikkujämsä and psychotherapist Antti Ervasti, struck a chord among Hongkongers who were unhappy with the situation in the city, according to Lam. A recipe book by chef Ho Siu-wai, who managed to overcome depression by cooking, was also extremely popular, Lam said. She added that they would not lower prices on the final day of the fair, as sales over the past week had been too slow. At other booths, exhibitors dangled discounts of up to 40 per cent for three books, while others sold outdated prints at HK$20 to HK$30. The Chinese translation of American historian Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny also sold out in three days, said Leo Chen, a distributor from Taiwanese company United Distribution. The mood from protests also permeated the fair in other ways, with five Lennon Walls filled with messages of support put up by local publishers. “Usually we put posters of our discounts on the wall outside, but this year, we decided to give readers a space to express their feelings,” said Jim Yu Lai-hei, editor-in-chief of Idea Publication. Yu, who had been participating in the book fair for seven years, said sales had dropped by about 10 per cent. For visitors who turned up, the fair was still the ultimate source for favourite books they were eyeing. “Even though I go to bookstores often, I will tell myself, ‘wait for the book fair’,” said 16-year-old student Kimberly Au Yeung Kwan-yi, who was there with a friend to look for comics. Mary Chan Man-lee, also in high school, said she always looked forward to the greater variety of books. “I’ll buy books by local authors that are more special,” she said, adding she had spent about HK$600 on comic books, which were about 20 per cent cheaper than at regular stores.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3019801/sales-down-least-10-cent-hong-kong-book-fair-2019
"Yuen Long recovers but anxiety looms over weekend protest against Sunday’s attacks, as residents, businesses lose faith in Hong Kong police","Two days after the late-night brutality at MTR station, life in the northern town returns to normal, but residents remain wary; Most point blame at police for what they see as failure to protect the public","5:14pm, 23 Jul, 2019","Shops and businesses have reopened in the Hong Kong district that was the scene of unprecedented violence on Sunday night, but residents say they have lost all faith in the city’s police.; Shoppers and children returned to malls in Yuen Long on Tuesday, a day after a shutdown turned the New Territories neighbourhood into a ghost town following attacks by rod-wielding men who targeted random commuters and protesters against the now-suspended extradition bill.","An air of anxiety still lingered, however. Restaurant Hok Kee Congee & Noodles, which has been operating at the heart of the district for decades, was one of the businesses that resumed operations after a partial closure on Monday. Manager Ezra Lam, 26, said they lost about HK$17,000 in revenue. Lam said he had lost trust in police’s ability to protect residents in case violence breaks out again. “Those men in white T-shirts beat people everywhere and no one was stopping them at all.” Officers were accused of turning a blind eye to the incident at 10.45pm on Sunday night and colluding with triads, believed to be behind the attacks at Yuen Long MTR station. The force has denied this, citing the need for backup when two officers at the scene realised they were ill-equipped to handle the situation, on top of stretched manpower as their comrades battled protesters in the city centre following a third major march against the extradition bill. The legislation would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city has no such agreement. Protesters want the complete withdrawal of the bill, among other demands, but the government has stood firm as weeks of rallies and demonstrations continue to rock the city. On Sunday night, some protesters were returning to Yuen Long from Sheung Wan when white-clad men with sticks and metal rods stormed the railway station in the northern town, attacking commuters indiscriminately. At least 45 people were injured and eight have been arrested over the incident, which raised tensions in the city and opened a new front in the escalating political crisis. Anger at police and those behind the late-night attack led to protesters planning a march on Saturday in Yuen Long. Moe Yu, 45, a shop manager at Book Castle in Yoho Mall, said he was worried about the coming demonstration. “They may spill into shopping malls,” Yu said. “I’m still thinking about whether to open the shop this weekend. We will decide later. Even if we open it, we will close immediately if crowds start coming in.” Yu added he had also lost trust in police whom he said had failed to protect residents on Sunday night. “They only put on a show and arrested a few people last night. Where were they on the night the attacks happened?” he said. On Tuesday at Yoho Mall, which is linked to the station where the attacks took place, residents, including the elderly were resting on benches while parents were seen with children and their domestic helpers as they shopped. Restaurants were also filled with diners. Resident Kelvin Lee, 35, brought his son with him to shop for groceries. “We did not come out yesterday as we heard there would be danger at around 3pm. But it seems like everything is OK today so I brought my son, who is on a summer break.” Lee also said shopping malls should be safe as there were security guards, but he would still look out for gathering crowds and did not intend to stay out late. Andy Cheung, a 19-year-old part-time salesperson at a fashion boutique in Yoho Mall, reported for work in the afternoon. “My parents were very worried. They said they would give me money and asked me not to go to work.” But Cheung insisted he was not concerned about safety issues in the district, and might join the weekend protest. “I think the incident last Sunday was very ridiculous. Not that I was shocked about such things happening in Hong Kong, but it’s the fact that there was no one to stop it.” Cheung said he hoped police would arrest all those involved and give a proper explanation about why they had arrived only after the mob had fled, or answer to the public over emergency calls that were reportedly not handled. “I don’t accept their explanation yesterday. There must be people here even though they had arranged for manpower on Hong Kong Island”, he added. Outside the malls at Castle Peak Road, a thoroughfare in the district, the owner of a dried seafood store said there were fewer people on the streets. “We closed earlier at around 4pm yesterday and lost around a few thousand dollars compared to normal days. The atmosphere was quite tense in the district.” The woman, who declined to be named, said she would observe the situation over the weekend to decide if she should open her store. “Those people attacked residents on purpose. All we can do is to avoid wearing black [the colour theme of protesters]. I also rescheduled some of my children’s activities to keep them safe,” she said. Yuki, 23, a staff member at a bubble tea store on the same road said he was not too worried about what would happen next. “I believe the weekend protest will be peaceful, so we will continue to open our store,” she said. “I don’t think police are helpful as they came really late that day. We also do not accept their apology.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019766/yuen-long-recovers-anxiety-looms-over-weekend-protest
"Give all Hong Kong residents $8,000 cash handout to boost retail and alleviate concerns after extradition bill protests, lawmaker Regina Ip says","Ip meets financial secretary amid pre-budget talks and suggests handout for all in view of city’s current economic and social conditions; Series of protests and violent clashes over extradition bill have seriously affected grass roots, she says","4:48pm, 23 Jul, 2019","Shops and businesses have reopened in the Hong Kong district that was the scene of unprecedented violence on Sunday night, but residents say they have lost all faith in the city’s police.; Shoppers and children returned to malls in Yuen Long on Tuesday, a day after a shutdown turned the New Territories neighbourhood into a ghost town following attacks by rod-wielding men who targeted random commuters and protesters against the now-suspended extradition bill.","Hong Kong’s financial chief should announce an HK$8,000 (US$1,024) cash handout for all residents to boost local consumption and retail after the recent mass protests, a prominent pro-establishment lawmaker has said. New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, who also serves as an adviser in Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s cabinet, dismissed the suggestion the proposal was meant to help her party win more votes in the coming elections, saying it was only for the people’s good. On Tuesday, Ip said she met Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po and told him that a cash handout should be given to all residents aged 18 or above, given the city’s current economic and social conditions. Chan is meeting people from various sectors to discuss the government’s next budget, to be rolled out in February next year. “We believe the government should directly hand out cash to every permanent resident … I think most people hope peace can be restored in Hong Kong, and society can be prosperous.” In March last year, Chan had also announced a handout of up to HK$4,000 (US$510). But only those who did not own a property or benefit from government allowances were eligible to apply for it. Many lawmakers, including Ip, criticised the scheme as too complicated and time-consuming as the eligible applicants were expected to receive the payment only later this year. Critics said the government should hand out cash to all residents aged 18 or above next time. The pro-establishment camp has been worrying about losing seats in the district council polls in November, and in the Legislative Council elections next year, because they have supported the government’s now-suspended extradition bill. The legislation would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong does not have such arrangements. Asked whether her proposal would boost her party’s prospect in the polls, Ip said: “Don’t just think that we are always eyeing elections. We are only proposing these because of the economic downturn and people’s concerns.” Ip also proposed the government should waive 25 per cent rent under short-term tenancies for six months as many local logistics firms were operating on land rented from the government based on such tenancies, and they would be badly affected by the US-China trade war. Chan should also help the logistics sector by waiving the annual examination fees for commercial vehicles, such as taxi and minibuses, for one year, she added.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019760/hong-kong-government-should-hand-out-hk8000-cash-all
Hong Kong protest hate figure Junius Ho’s parents’ graves vandalised amid extradition bill anger,The rural leader has come in for criticism over alleged links with masked men who attacked subway passengers on Sunday; Earlier in the day Ho stormed out of a TV interview after a heated row with a pro-democracy legislator,"4:14pm, 23 Jul, 2019","At least 45 people were injured when the mob attacked anyone in their path at Yuen Long’s MTR station, including passengers on a train, passers-by and protesters returning from a major march against the extradition bill.; On Monday he admitted having had dinner with some of them that night, and while he distanced himself from the violence, he said that villagers in the district were merely “defending their homes” and that it was no secret they had vowed to drive the protesters away.","A fiery pro-Beijing lawmaker who has become a hate figure for Hong Kong’s anti-government protest movement suffered a deeply personal attack on Tuesday when his parents’ graves were trashed. Many opposing the now-suspended extradition bill have made Junius Ho Kwan-yiu the target of their anger after he was seen shaking hands with men in white T-shirts who were accused of assaulting protesters and train passengers in the northern town of Yuen Long. While police had cordoned off the site in Leung Tin village on Tuesday afternoon after the news broke, pictures showing the vandalised headstones were posted on Facebook and popular online forum LIHKG. One showed someone aiming a middle finger at one of the graves, which also had also been defaced with a spray-painted profanity. The Chinese words for “official-triad collusion” had also been painted on the wall behind the gravestones, referring to the involvement of suspected gangsters in Sunday night’s attacks on protesters and travellers at Yuen Long’s MTR station. After inspecting the graves in the evening, a visibly upset Ho, who filed a police complaint, called on the perpetrators to surrender themselves to the authorities because they had done “something hated by both man and God”.  “You can come to me and talk if you have issues with me,” he said. “You don’t have to mess with my parents’ graves … If you are willing to confess, my parents and I will forgive you.” The desecration of graves is deeply offensive in Chinese culture because of Confucian concepts of filial piety and reverence for ancestors. Thirty-nine pro-establishment lawmakers issued a joint statement on Tuesday night deploring the vandalism and urging police to pursue the culprits. The outspoken lawmaker stormed out of a live television interview earlier in the day, after opposition legislator Eddie Chu Hoi-dick refused to call for a halt to more anti-government protests that are planned for the coming weekend. The pair were taking part in a current affairs programme when Ho lost his temper and pounded his fists on the table. “You are a lawmaker who brought violence into the Legislative Council,” Ho said. “Now you are spreading violence to communities on a scale a hundred times larger. You are an outright scumbag!” Police later said that more than 100 men were involved in the attacks, including members of the notorious 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs. Ho raised eyebrows when a video clip circulated online showed him shaking hands and thanking some of the men, dressed in white T-shirts that night. Ho denied online rumours that he had applied for, or was seeking, United States citizenship. A group of 20 young protesters rallied outside Ho’s Tin Shui Wai district office, a day after others smashed glass panels and pelted eggs at his base in Tsuen Wan. Chanting “evil Ho harms citizens, colludes with thugs”, protesters put up a Lennon Wall of paper messages that included offensive references to his mother. By the time police officers arrived after receiving a complaint from a member of Ho’s staff, the protesters had already left. Ho’s Tuen Mun office at Melody Garden was closed when dozens of masked protesters turned up to post colourful stickers and notes on the gate at 3.30pm. Separately, an online petition was started on Tuesday morning by people claiming to be from the sports community, urging the Jockey Club to revoke Ho’s membership and retire his horses.  The initiators wrote in the petition that they had collected thousands of signatures and would announce further actions when the number reached 10,000. Ho’s Wikipedia page had been revised more than 70 times since midnight on Sunday, with additions including phrases such as “is known for advocating violence against his opponents”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019750/pro-beijing-lawmaker-junius-ho-storms-out-live-tv-interview
Cook caught up in shocking violence near Hong Kong MTR station recalls horrific ordeal as 20 people attacked him with sticks and canes as he made his way home from work,"Calvin So was left severely injured with skin on his back torn, his hands and shoulders wounded and swollen; Embattled officers face heavy criticism for arriving at scene too late to stop attacks but pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip calls for understanding","2:26pm, 23 Jul, 2019","A cook caught up in shocking violence in a northern Hong Kong district on Sunday night has recalled the horrendous experience of his journey home.; Hong Kong has seen a wave of anti-government, mostly peaceful, protests since early June. The city’s legislature was stormed and trashed on July 1, after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor refused to fully withdraw the bill, which would have allowed the transfer of suspects to other jurisdictions including mainland China.; Ip added she hoped the Chinese army would not be needed to handle the current crisis.","Calvin So, 23, had finished work at a restaurant in Yoho Mall, the shopping centre next to Yuen Long MTR station in northwestern Hong Kong, and was walking towards an exit just after 9.45pm. He was attacked by a group of men after simply saying: “There are lots of people in white clothes here.” “Some people approached me. Soon after, a person started beating me and more joined in,” So said, adding he was attacked by about 20 people, armed with sticks and canes, during the assault. “I didn’t do anything and asked them to stop beating me. But they just ignored me,” he said. The railway station was the scene of unprecedented violence on Sunday night as a marauding gang of men in white T-shirts ambushed people including demonstrators returning home from a protest march elsewhere in the city. Some 45 people were injured and 11 have since been arrested. So’s ordeal lasted for around five minutes before he tried to flee to safety. He was chased and struck several more times as he escaped the brutality. The violent attacks left his back severely injured with torn skin. His hands and legs were wounded and his shoulders swollen. He was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital for treatment and said the injuries left him unable to sleep on his back on the first night. “I was in pain whenever something touched my back,” he said. So’s recovery was expected to take several weeks and he hoped police would investigate the assaults. “There should be at least a public explanation,” he said. “It is unacceptable to see those people randomly attacking others.” By 6pm on Tuesday, five men were still receiving treatment at Tuen Mun Hospital. Among them, one was critical, one was serious and the remaining three were stable. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s former security chief and veteran pro-establishment lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee called for residents to show understanding over police handling of the violence, arguing the force had faced attacks comparable to “guerilla warfare” over the past two months. “The force has been worked to the point of exhaustion and manpower is strained … with so many large-scale protests and attacks since June 9,” Ip, a member of the government’s advisory panel, said on a radio programme on Tuesday. The city’s embattled police force came under heavy fire for arriving at the scene too late to stop the attacks on anti-government protesters, journalists and passers-by at the station, as well as terrified passengers on a train. Ip, an Executive Council member and New People’s Party lawmaker, believed many officers from Yuen Long were deployed to Hong Kong Island as protesters laid siege to Beijing’s liaison office following a march against a now-suspended extradition bill. Lam first suspended the bill, then declared it “dead” on July 9. “I hope Hongkongers can understand our police have done very well handling things such as public security and theft, so the overall crime rate is very low,” Ip said. “What happened over the past month or so is not normal violence, but continued violence. It is like facing urban guerillas.” “I am worried some people are trying to force the People’s Liberation Army to come here,” she said, though she believed the Hong Kong and central governments would try to prevent this as much as possible. She also warned that while there were no casualties at the siege of the liaison office, there was strong political meaning to the actions, with the compound vandalised and the national emblem on the building front defaced. Meanwhile, about 30 members of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC) Hong Kong and journalists silently protested outside the press club on Tuesday morning to condemn the violence directed at journalists when covering the protests last weekend, particularly the “sickening scenes of mob violence” in Yuen Long. At least four local journalists were attacked by the marauding gang on Sunday. Two victims were reportedly from Apple Daily, a Chinese-language newspaper, and one each from the Stand News website and cable broadcaster Now TV. One female reporter was attacked during a live online report. The news outlet said her hands and right shoulder were hurt and she suffered swelling on the back of her head. President of the press club Jodi Schneider said: “We are out here standing for press freedom and to say yes to press freedom, no to violence against journalists. We are renewing our call for independent investigation by a third party, into any harassment or violence against journalists during the protests in Hong Kong.” In a statement, the club called on Hong Kong police and the authorities to urgently find and bring to justice those who carried out the unprecedented attack. A joint statement issued on Monday by the Hong Kong Journalists Association, the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association and the Independent Commentators Association made an urgent appeal to local police to protect citizens and journalists.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019725/cook-caught-shocking-violence-hong-kong-mtr-station
Are Yuen Long attacks a sign of deepening fractures in Hong Kong society that could lead to anarchy amid extradition bill crisis?,"Analysts pin blame on government’s ‘flaccid’ response over ongoing unrest, expressing fears neighbourhood crisis will spread and spiral out of control; They urge an independent inquiry into actions of protesters and police","11:00am, 23 Jul, 2019","The unprecedented violence at a Hong Kong railway station on Sunday, when groups of white-clad men attacked protesters and passengers, has deepened tensions in a city already rocked by the extradition bill crisis, with analysts warning the chaos could bring anarchy if left unchecked.","Andrew Fung Ho-keung, chief executive of the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, said that while the attacks at Yuen Long MTR station should not be condoned, they might signify fractures in society caused by the continuing protests. “Some residents have been complaining about the impact on businesses and daily life as the protests have spread to new towns in the New Territories,” Fung said. “I’m worried that the tension between residents from opposing camps will spiral, with some taking the law into their own hands. “It is doubtful if police can get the situation under control. There is a realistic fear of civil strife and virtual anarchy.” But Fung and security consultant Steve Vickers said the government was to blame for failing to devise a solution to the political crisis, sparked by the now-suspended extradition bill. The legislation would have allowed the transfer of fugitives from the city to jurisdictions with which it has no extradition deal, including mainland China. Witnesses said no police officers were in sight as dozens of men suspected to be triad members stormed the station close to midnight on Sunday and forcibly opened closed entrances. They hurled objects at protesters and travellers alike, and assaulted members of the public. Among victims were protesters returning from an anti-government mass march against the extradition bill on Hong Kong Island earlier in the day, which also ended in clashes with police and tear gas fired in the city centre. In the Yuen Long case, at least 45 people were injured in the late-night violence. On Monday Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor pledged a full investigation into the skirmishes in the heart of the city and the bloody incidents in Yuen Long. Fung noted that weeks of protests had heightened tensions in the city, with government supporters removing Post-it notes containing messages of support for demonstrators at Lennon Walls in some districts. Frustrated by what they saw as the government’s failure to respond to demands – mainly to withdraw the bill and to investigate the alleged use of excessive force by police – protesters have resorted to rallies and posting their messages on such walls, which have become a new flashpoint for confrontations. Kin Hung Kam-in, vice-chairman of Kwun Tong District Council, said there could be a backlash against radical young protesters in some neighbourhoods. “That’s why some residents have started to remove Post-it notes from Lennon Walls,” said Hung, who is a member of the pro-government Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. Vickers, chief executive of risk consultancy firm Steve Vickers and Associates, said the alleged involvement of triads in the Yuen Long attacks represented a worrying escalation to what was already a highly complex situation. “Yuen Long has a long history of triad activities, and in the last couple of weeks there has been considerable tension between protesters and local businessmen and other luminaries who are very opposed to the demonstrators and their activities, including the establishment of a Lennon Wall there,” said Vickers, who is also a former head of the criminal intelligence bureau under the colonial police. In October 2014, some people arrested over clashes between Occupy protesters and rivals in Mong Kok were found to also have triad ties. The Occupy movement was a 79-day civil disobedience campaign for greater democracy that brought parts of the city to a standstill. Referring to the current administration’s stance on the extradition-bill crisis, Vickers said: “The government’s somewhat flaccid response is only angering demonstrators and essentially escalating matters.” Professor Joseph Chan Cho-wai, a political scientist at the University of Hong Kong, said protesters should pay attention to whether their actions were acceptable to other residents in their neighbourhood. “However, I don’t think Lennon Walls are causing serious nuisance to daily life in districts,” he said. Chan and Fung said the government should set up a commission of inquiry to review the actions of protesters and police since last month as one way to ease tensions. On Friday, more than 30 leaders from across civil society, including ex-ministers and leading microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung, called on the administration to launch an independent inquiry into the recent clashes between protesters and police. On July 9, Chief Executive Carrie Lam had rejected calls for an investigation into police actions, saying the matter would be left to the Independent Police Complaints Council. But Chan said: “Lam doesn’t have the political will to resolve the ongoing crisis.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019649/are-yuen-long-attacks-sign-deepening-fractures-hong-kong

In a shockingly violent rampage of unprecedented lawlessness, a mob of men in white T-shirts stormed into the Yuen Long MTR station, indiscriminately attacking people with sticks and iron rods. Their target appeared to be black-clad protesters returning from Sunday’s major march against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, but the assailants beat up anyone they came across, including passengers on trains, passers-by and even journalists at the scene. Some were waving Chinese national flags and placards reading, “Defend Yuen Long, defend our homeland.” Police later said more than 100 men were involved in the attack and a second one at midnight, including members of the notorious 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs. Word of the imminent trouble on Sunday had spread earlier through Apple’s airdrop file transfer service and social media, warning protesters not to get off at Yuen Long station amid reports that a crowd of suspicious men had gathered near Fung Yau Street East. Protesters had placed clothes of every colour except black at ticket-vending machines at Central station, along with written warnings for those heading back to Yuen Long to get changed first. A message had been circulated the day before among closed circles, calling on Yuen Long residents not to wear black, the preferred colour of the protest movement. Villagers in the district also said they were reminded by their rural leaders not to venture out on Sunday if they could. The warnings went mostly unheeded, amid a climate of rumours and false alarms, and the sheer scale and ferocity of the bloody violence that followed stunned the city. “Don’t come in!” passengers in the paid area of the station yelled at the invaders. And to fellow travellers: “Everyone, please don’t retreat or else these men will storm in!” They tried to protect themselves with open umbrellas, sheltered young pupils, and called on each other to stop provoking the uncontrollable mob. Some put on a brave front, chanting in unison at their attackers and hoping to keep them at the scene until police arrived. Little did they expect that officers would not attend the scene in force until 40 minutes later, when the first attack was over. “I saw a woman lying on the ground and some white-shirted people around her with their faces covered. Some of them were brandishing sticks and metal rods, some of them were not,” one witness recalled. “She was the one later referred to as the injured pregnant woman online. Her condition was stable but she did not know the whereabouts of her husband, who was chased after and beaten.” Around 100 to 150 men in white T-shirts were stationed at different parts of the station at the time, he added. A spokesman for the Hospital Authority said accident and emergency departments at public hospitals had not received any cases of pregnant women related to the incident, and called on people to seek treatment when necessary. Some tried to fight back with a fire hose and an extinguisher they found at the station, but they were overwhelmed by the assailants who storming into the paid area and onto the platform where trains were pulling in. “Ladies, please move inside the carriage,” some of the men on the train shouted as they tried to protect them by standing near the doors and making sure no one was left behind on the platform. For 10 minutes, passengers on the train were indiscriminately assaulted with sticks and rods. One man was seen kneeling at the train door, imploring the mob to stop. Video footage showed traumatised women standing on their seats and pleading for mercy. “Please don’t beat us, I beg you.” “I’m only trying to head home after a day of work.” “We are just civilians.” The MTR made an announcement declaring train services suspended and asking everyone to alight. The railway operator later explained that the train driver was only aware of the doors being obstructed and did not see the violent attack. It was past 11pm when the driver, responding to passengers’ pleas for help, pulled the train away from the platform after the doors could be closed. Trains, which had been bypassing the station since 11pm after word of the violence spread, only resumed stops at Yuen Long some 20 minutes later. The shocking violence was broadcast live on Facebook by Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who also suffered injuries and needed 18 stitches for a mouth wound. Vincent Lo, a fourth-year university student, said he had called 999 at 10.28pm when he saw the huge crowd outside the station, where he could hear women speaking in Mandarin while standing next to the men in white T-shirts. “The officer [at the control centre] noted my request coldly and only said police would arrive in 10 to 15 minutes when I asked,” he told the Post. “That, to me, was already too long. It was totally unreasonable for them to arrive at 11.20pm.” Other witnesses, along with the management of the Yoho Mall linked to the station, said police could not be reached when they tried to report the case. Police later explained the call centre in the New Territories North was overwhelmed by hundreds of 999 emergency calls made between 10pm and midnight. Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said on Monday that two officers had arrived at the station at 10.52pm, seven minutes after they received a report about the violence, but decided to call for help after realising they did not have enough protective gear. A police source defended their strategy, saying weeks of mass rallies and protest violence had put a serious strain on manpower and resources. He said more than 10 per cent of manpower had been drafted in from each of the five police regions to deal with Sunday’s mass march. The source admitted there was not enough manpower in Yuen Long to deal with a series of emergencies the same day. Officers from the Emergency Unit, who have anti-riot gear on board their vehicles, were busy dealing with fights, assaults, and a fire in the district before the violence broke out at the train station. More than 500 officers from a regional response contingent, who were carrying out a clearance operation against protesters in Sheung Wan at the time, had already been redeployed to Yuen Long to deal with chaos there, the source added. He said the Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai police stations were besieged by more than 100 protesters each, and fights had broken out in the streets in different areas, including one in the Yuen Long town area. By the time more than 30 officers arrived as reinforcements at 11.20pm, most of the attackers had already fled. “I really witnessed a lot of people in white shirts running right past them, and they did not even stop them,” said the man who saw the pregnant woman in trouble. “They only raised their batons and roared, but did not arrest anyone.” An angry crowd, joined by local residents who headed to the scene after finding out about the violence in the news, surrounded the officers when they arrived. “Where have you been? You are supposed to protect us,” they shouted, yelling profanities in frustration. “Why would you allow those men to leave so easily?” Police later explained that they had to let people go because they did not see them breaking the law and could not arrest someone simply based on the colour of their clothing. Shortly before midnight, more than 200 people confronted the white-clad men at the entrance of nearby Nam Pin Wai village. Police reinforcements were then sent to the village to investigate. Some had hurled objects, including road construction lights, at dozens of protesters who were standing on the staircases outside the MTR exit, forcing them to retreat. No police officers could be seen inside the station, except one who was briefly spotted in the station control room. Desperate people had been banging on the glass window of the room and pressing the intercom button, urging MTR staff to close the gate of the exit leading to the village. But their calls were only entertained at around 12.25am. It was then that the men in white launched a second attack, with more than a dozen of them suddenly appearing at the gate, forcing open the shutters and rushing inside. People in the station tried to fight them off through the shutters, then fled when they stormed in, running towards Yoho Mall 1 through another station exit. Those who could not escape in time were viciously attacked and beaten without mercy. Others, having given up hope that police would intervene, eventually triggered fire alarms with their umbrellas in the mall to alert firefighters. A team of 100 riot police officers went to Nam Pin Wai village, where most of the men in white shirts had gathered, at around 1am. But no arrests were made as police said they did not find any weapons or come across anything suspicious. In a statement, the MTR Corporation said in a statement it was deeply upset by the violence and stressed that staff had handled the situation as best as they could. “The fact that at the time there were only three MTR staff and one contractor staff, who are all civilians, they could not handle the situation and had to rely on the assistance of law enforcement authorities,” the statement read. In a joint petition, a group of MTR operating staff demanded management and police come up with measures to guarantee the safety of passengers and railway employees, warning they might consider going on strike.

But events took a bloody turn on Sunday night when a horde of men, dressed in white and brandishing poles and bats, unleashed an apparently coordinated attack on protesters, journalists and passers-by in Yuen Long, leaving at least 45 people injured. The Hong Kong police force has come under renewed criticism over the attack and the revelation that officers did not reach the scene of the violence until 35 minutes after the rampage was reported. The delay prompted claims that local authorities knowingly allowed the attacks to happen, suspicions that grew when a pro-Beijing lawmaker was filmed shaking hands with a group of white-clad men. Sharing a video on Twitter of the attackers, many of whom made no effort to conceal their faces, US Senator Marco Rubio said on Monday: “They didn’t seem too concerned about getting caught or stopped by authorities. It isn’t hard to figure out who sent them”. Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, however, has dismissed as “groundless” the accusations that her administration or the police force colluded with the mob. The South China Morning Post previously reported that the more-than 100 men who carried out Sunday’s attacks included members of the city’s 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs. Six people were arrested on Monday evening for their involvement in the violence, while city authorities say more arrests could follow. On Monday, Trump did not directly address Sunday night’s events, but called the ongoing protests “relatively non-violent”. He said he hoped Xi would “do the right thing”, without elaborating. “China could stop [the protests] if they wanted,” the US leader said. A wave of criticism launched at the protesters by Beijing via its state media apparatus on Monday made no mention of the violent attacks, although a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said the government condemned “all violent behaviour”. Meanwhile, the central government’s envoy to Hong Kong, Wang Zhimin, whose office building was besieged by egg- and paint-throwing protesters on Sunday, said the demonstrators’ actions “seriously hurt the feelings of all Chinese people, including 7 million Hongkongers”. Trump has previously shied away from weighing in on the protests, which began in June over a now-suspended legislative proposal that would have allowed fugitives to be extradited to mainland China. When asked about the demonstrations days after they began, Trump said he expected Beijing and Hong Kong to be able to “work it out”. Before the bill’s suspension, the US State Department expressed “grave concern” about the proposed amendment, and called on Hong Kong’s authorities to respect residents’ right to protest freely.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/article/3019672/donald-trump-says-xi-jinping-acted-responsibly-hong-kong-extradition
"Hong Kong police arrest six men over Yuen Long rampage by weapon-wielding mob, after unprecedented night of violence following extradition protests","Arrests are first in connection with bloody attacks, in wake of accusations of slow police response on Sunday night; Dozens more suspects on radar including members of notorious triad gangs, say police","11:48pm, 22 Jul, 2019","The city’s embattled police force came under heavy fire for turning up too late to stop the shocking attacks on anti-government protesters, journalists and passers-by at the station, as well as terrified passengers on trains.; Beleaguered Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, struggling to overcome a governance crisis that began more than a month ago over the now-suspended extradition bill, condemned the violence in Yuen Long, but first slammed the protesters who besieged Beijing’s liaison office in Western district on Sunday night and defaced the national emblem on the building front.; Protesters vandalised pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu’s Tsuen Wan office, which was empty at the time, after he said the white-clad men in Yuen Long were merely “defending their home” from anti-government protesters.","Six men were arrested on Monday night as Hong Kong police began hunting down the mob responsible for an unprecedented rampage at a train station in the northern town of Yuen Long that left 45 people injured the night before. Sources told the Post more than 100 men in white T-shirts were involved in Sunday night’s bloody violence, including members of the notorious 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs. The six men – arrested for unlawful assembly – were aged 24-54. Some of them had triad backgrounds, while others were drivers, hawkers, renovation workers or unemployed. Police swooped on the men at their homes in the Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai areas on Monday evening as they moved on those suspected of taking part in Sunday’s rampage. In a press briefing late on Monday, Senior Superintendent Chan Tin-chu, of the New Territories North regional headquarters, said they identified several individuals who had joined the attack from security camera footage, online videos, and other intelligence. Chan, who said other people could still be arrested, said the motives behind the violence had yet to be established, adding those arrested could still face other charges. Usually bustling Yuen Long became a ghost town on Monday, with businesses closed and streets deserted, amid rumours and fears of more violence. Office director Wang Zhimin warned that the protesters had challenged the bottom line of the “one country, two systems” governing principle for Hong Kong by pelting the building with eggs and using black paintballs to vandalise the symbol of Beijing’s presence in the city. “They have damaged the spirit of the rule of law in Hong Kong … and seriously hurt the feelings of all Chinese people, including 7 million Hongkongers,” Wang said. While Wang did not mention the Yuen Long violence, business and media groups, social workers, Catholic leaders, district councillors, lawmakers and Lam’s top advisers were united in criticising the perpetrators. Deploring both the siege of the liaison office and the Yuen Long mayhem, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce for the first time joined calls for Lam to formally withdraw the bill and set up an independent commission of inquiry to look into the facts surrounding the continuing protest crisis. But Executive Council heavyweights Bernard Chan and Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee insisted there was no need for such an inquiry, backing the government’s unwillingness to question the conduct of the city’s police force in dealing with the protests. Reflecting diminished confidence in the law-and-order situation, US consumer tech giant Apple closed all five of its retail stores in Hong Kong in the afternoon to allow staff to go home early. While police said they had no evidence of imminent violence in Yuen Long, stores remained closed in the upmarket Yoho mall, next to the scene of Sunday night’s chaos, and key shopping zones such as Yuen Long Plaza, the Yuen Long section of Castle Peak Road and Fau Tsoi Street. “We are closing for the day because the situation is getting dangerous,” a cashier at a restaurant said. “We will lose tens of thousands of dollars in business for the day.” It was a similar scene in Tuen Mun, a 15-minute drive from Yuen Long, where shops along the town’s busiest street and wet market closed early in the afternoon amid persistent rumours of trouble to come. The city’s leader, flanked by her full team of 16 ministers as well as Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung, held a grim-faced press conference to denounce Sunday night’s violence, starting with what happened at the liaison office. “The government strongly condemns the protesters who defaced the national emblem outside the building. They blatantly challenged China’s national sovereignty … and angered the whole city,” she said. She also hit out at those behind the Yuen Long attack, saying: “Shocking violence took place in Yuen Long, and the government will also investigate that and follow up in accordance with the law.” Asked if she could still govern Hong Kong when defenceless citizens were being brutalised in public by suspected gangsters, Lam replied: “My team and I are here to show that while some of our work was not done properly … my colleagues and I have been making efforts to identify the root causes of this discontent.” Also questioned about her focus on the defacing of the Chinese emblem at the liaison office above the Yuen Long attacks, Lam said: “Hong Kong’s status as a commercial and financial centre, and the protection of residents’ daily lives, are very important, but﻿ … it is of utmost importance for Hong Kong to continue to successfully implement ‘one country, two systems’.” She promised a full investigation into the train station attacks, decrying the lawlessness and offering her sympathies to the injured. “Violence is not a solution to any problem. Violence will only breed more violence,” she said. Pro-Beijing lawmakers also condemned the protest outside the liaison office before criticising the Yuen Long attacks, while opposition pan-democrats accused police of “colluding” with triad gangsters and deliberately letting them terrorise citizens. Responding to fierce criticism for failing to stop the rampaging mob, the police commissioner explained that the first responders were two officers who did not take action because the odds were overwhelming, and manpower in the district was tied up dealing with other emergencies. Lo also pointed out that many officers had been deployed to Hong Kong Island, where riot police on Sunday night used tear gas and rubber bullets to drive thousands of protesters off the roads they had taken over. Anti-government protests broke out in Hong Kong last month after Lam refused to fully withdraw the extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of suspects to other jurisdictions including mainland China. Lam first suspended the bill, then declared it “dead” on July 9.

Mainland Chinese sentiment on protests ‘may spur tougher line on Hong Kong’ following violence in wake of extradition bill controversy,"Mood shifts across border as state media condemns vandalism of liaison office, but there is no mention of armed mob attacking civilians in Yuen Long; Observers say Beijing could take a more hardline position to try to end the situation if it deteriorates, including declaring a state of emergency","11:30pm, 22 Jul, 2019","As a result, while Hongkongers focused on an armed mob attacking civilians in Yuen Long, there was uproar on the mainland over protesters laying siege to the central government’s liaison office, where the national emblem was defaced and anti-Chinese obscenities spray-painted on the building.; After another huge anti-government march from Causeway Bay to Wan Chai on Sunday, protests spread to the heart of the business district, and more than 1,000 demonstrators besieged the liaison office in Sai Ying Pun, throwing eggs at the building and shining laser light beams at staff trapped inside.; The latest protests over the now-suspended extradition bill – which would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including mainland China – came as the top leadership in Beijing is deliberating how to handle the demonstrations and violent clashes that have rocked Hong Kong since early June. Unrest in the city is expected to be high on the agenda when the country’s leaders hold their annual Beidaihe meeting in northern China early next month.; Meanwhile, official media including People’s Daily, news agency Xinhua and broadcaster CCTV all published sternly worded commentaries on Monday condemning the attack on the liaison office. They received hundreds of thousands of likes from readers.","News of Sunday night’s brutal attacks on protesters and journalists in suburban Hong Kong has been censored on the mainland, but vandalism at Beijing’s liaison office received blanket coverage. Many on the mainland were angered by the protesters’ actions, questioning whether they had lost their purpose. Dozens were injured when police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, who fought back with umbrellas, bottles, bricks and poles, in areas near the liaison office. Beijing resident Cissy Li said the scenes had changed her mind about the protests. “In the past, I could share the Hong Kong people’s sentiment about political events and I very much supported them,” Li said. “But now I’m confused about these radicals – what are they really after?” Observers said the escalating violence in Hong Kong could spur the leadership to take a more assertive stance in managing the city’s affairs in the future, weakening its autonomy. Many across the border were deeply offended by images of the vandalised national emblem and obscenities levelled at mainland Chinese. “[The protesters] have gone beyond the normal channels to express their opinions and became violent in order to press for their demands,” said a man surnamed Yue from Shijiazhuang in Hebei province. His view was echoed by many social media users on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter. The state broadcaster dedicated almost one-third of its strictly choreographed evening newscast to interviews and official statements criticising the protesters’ behaviour, and close-up images of the vandalised office building. Media reports about the Yuen Long attacks could be found by mainlanders via posts on Weibo, but there was no mention in official media. Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University’s law school, said the public mood could encourage Beijing to take a stronger line on Hong Kong. “If the protests continue and push the Hong Kong government to its limit, and the government fails to respond to the current crisis, then Beijing will be forced to take some measures,” Tian said. According to Tian, Beijing could take a more hardline position to try to end the situation if it deteriorates, with one option being to declare a state of emergency in Hong Kong and apply mainland laws in the city. He was referring to Article 18 under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. It states that the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress can decide that Hong Kong is “in a state of emergency” on the grounds of turmoil that endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the Hong Kong government. Under such circumstances, Beijing can “issue an order applying the relevant national laws” in Hong Kong. Guo Wanda, executive vice-president of the China Development Institute, a think tank in Shenzhen, agreed. He said the protests in Hong Kong would prompt Beijing to take a tougher stance, especially if the violence continued. But Zhu Jie, a professor specialising in Hong Kong law at Wuhan University, said the situation in the city was a long way off the stage where Beijing could justify such drastic action as declaring a state of emergency. “Although the radical protesters are testing Beijing’s bottom line in terms of tolerance, we can see from the commentaries in state media that the central government is still restrained and continues to support the city’s government and the police,” Zhu said. “Beijing will stick to the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.” Qin Qianhong, another law professor from Wuhan University, agreed that declaring a state of emergency was a last resort and not a step that would be easily taken. “Up until now, the protests have been generally peaceful and there’s no sign that the Hong Kong government and police have lost control,” Qin said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3019662/mainland-chinese-sentiment-protests-may-spur-tougher-line-hong
Hong Kong police chief defends officers arriving 35 minutes after first reports of Yuen Long mob violence against protesters and MTR passengers,"Review of manpower and response times to be held, says Stephen Lo, following outcry; Commissioner of Police denies colluding with white-clad mob, which has been linked to triad gangs","10:35pm, 22 Jul, 2019","Meeting the press on Monday afternoon, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor drew a clear line between her government and the attackers. ; The police would look into gathering evidence as soon as possible and make arrests, he added.","The Hong Kong police chief admitted on Monday that officers arrived 35 minutes after receiving the first report of attacks on protesters at Yuen Long railway station, but he denied colluding with triads over the mob violence. Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung said that riot police arrived late on Sunday night because the force’s capacity had been stretched across Hong Kong Island dealing with protests, and promised a review of manpower and response times. His comments came as hundreds of social workers marched on Monday afternoon against the “police’s failure to protect Yuen Long residents from thugs”, before handing over evidence they had gathered of gang members assaulting residents. They also lodged police misconduct complaints at the district’s police station, the scene of a separate protest organised by pan-democratic lawmakers earlier on Monday. A spokesman for Yoho Mall, which is next to the station and where some of Sunday’s attacks took place, said mall officials could not get through to police when they tried to report the incident. Residents eventually helped take care of the injured, providing them with water and first aid, the shopping centre’s spokesman said. A law enforcement source said that hundreds of 999 calls flooded the police call centre in New Territories North between 10pm and midnight on Sunday. The attacks, which left at least 45 people injured, started at around 10.45pm, when a mob of men in white T-shirts, whom witnesses described as triad gangsters, attacked black-clad protesters and other passengers with sticks and metal rods at Yuen Long MTR station. Pan-democratic lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, representing New Territories West, said: “Police didn’t show up while thugs rampaged through the station and attacked Yuen Long residents indiscriminately last night. “There is clear collusion between police and the gangs.” The drama came as relations between police and the public have been strained by a series of extradition bill protests, some of which have ended in clashes between officers and protesters. “Everyone should distance themselves from violence. Any accusation that the administration, me, the police chief and his colleagues colluded with the mob is groundless,” Lam said. “Such accusations hope to weaken the administration and make it harder for us to run the city.” Lo said in the same press conference that police first received a call about the Yuen Long violence at 10.45pm on Sunday. Two officers who arrived on the scene seven minutes later backed off and called for help, after deciding they did not have the equipment to deal with armed crowds. The assailants left by the time police reinforcements arrived at 11.20pm. Explaining the late arrival, Lo said that officers had to attend to other assaults and arson incidents in Yuen Long, with resources also having to be deployed to Hong Kong Island. “Every time there is a major event which may lead to violent confrontation, we have to redeploy our manpower from various districts to Hong Kong Island, so that I can ensure sufficient manpower to deal with these incidents,” Lo said. “Violence will only breed more violence. We will review our manpower deployment and do our best to ensure the public order and safety in all districts of Hong Kong.” Asked why some police stations in the vicinity of the Yuen Long attacks shut their doors on Sunday night, Lo said it was for safety reasons because large groups of protesters were surrounding the stations. The public could still reach the police through the 999 hotline, he added. “I want to reiterate that the police will not tolerate any violence. And we will pursue the attackers at all costs, in order to bring them to justice,” Lo said. Yuen Long District Commander and Chief Superintendent Lee Wai-man, who received the petition from lawmakers, said police were unable to keep up with the number of 999 calls they received about the incident. He added that the force had not received any intelligence regarding any fresh attacks on Monday. In the afternoon, hundreds of social workers marched from Long Ping MTR station to the police station, accompanied by 30 officers on the protesters’ request. “We are exercising our legal right as citizens of Hong Kong to report crimes. It is the police’s responsibility to protect us social workers in doing so,” said Lun Chi-wai, president of Hong Kong Social Workers’ General Union.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019657/hong-kong-police-chief-defends-officers-arriving-35
"Day after brutal attack on Hong Kong extradition bill protesters, Yuen Long is a ghost town","Shops in the northern district, and others nearby, closed early as people stayed away fearing further violence; On Sunday night scores of men with sticks and metal rods rampaged through a subway station, attacking protesters and passers-by","8:30pm, 22 Jul, 2019","On Sunday night scores of men with sticks and metal rods rampaged through the station, attacking black-clad protesters and passengers, leaving at least 45 injured. The protesters had been on their way home after taking part in an extradition bill march on Hong Kong Island.","A district in northern Hong Kong was rendered a ghost town on Monday, a day after a rod-wielding gang launched an indiscriminate attack on train passengers. Most shops in Yuen Long were closed by the afternoon, with residents staying away for fear of fresh violence. Police had no evidence of imminent further attacks on Monday, according to district commander Lee Wai-man. But rumours of a repeat prompted shops to close in the upmarket Yoho mall next to Yuen Long MTR station, where the violence took place, and key shopping areas such as Yuen Long Plaza, the Yuen Long section of Castle Peak Road and Fau Tsoi Street. On Monday the densely populated town, popular with mainland Chinese shoppers, was deserted. Shops closed at midday, or did not open at all. “We closed the doors at 3pm and let my staff go home early, for safety’s sake,” said Tse Ching-yuen, 88, of Tai Tung Bakery on Fau Tsoi Street. “I have never seen anything like [Sunday’s violence], and my staff are very frightened,” added Tse, whose shop, almost 80 years old, employs eight workers. By 3pm at Yoho, almost all of about 100 shops were closed, with the lights off. “I need to ensure the safety of my four staff,” said the manager of a hotpot restaurant at the mall, who added that, “beyond the safety issue, virtually no one is coming to shop”. At Yuen Long Plaza, 1.8km from Yoho, almost all of the 100 shops shut after lunchtime. “We are closing for the day because the situation is getting dangerous,” a cashier at a restaurant said. “We will lose tens of thousands of dollars in business for the day.” A man surnamed Wong, who owned a bakery on Castle Peak Road, let his five staff go home early. “All our workers are worried about their safety, with rumours flying around, so we let them leave early, at about 3pm to 4pm,” he said. “It’s even worse than typhoon season. What we saw yesterday was a lack of law and order. It is the police’s job to maintain it.” At the nearby Long Ping station, all shops lowered the shutters before social workers’ groups marched from the station to the district’s police station, to complain about what they said was the police turning a blind eye to the attackers – something the force has denied. Shops at a wet market in Tuen Mun closed one to two hours earlier than normal, shop owners citing either safety concerns or a lack of custom. “It’s supposed to be rush hour, with lots of customers heading home from work,” lamented one butcher. On Tuen Mun Heung Sze Wui Road, one of the busiest streets, most shops had closed early. Some government-run sports and cultural centres were closed early at 7pm on Monday, also due to safety concerns. They included Yuen Long Stadium and the Yuen Long Theatre. In Tsuen Wan, shops at two busy shopping centres – Luk Yeung Galleria and Tsuen Fung Centre Shopping Arcade – also closed for half a day, but for different reasons. Protesters there trashed the office of legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, inside Tsuen Fung Centre, reducing the empty office to a mess of egg shells and glass shards. The vandals were incensed at the rural leader for shaking hands with white-clad men — said to include the attackers – and thanking them on Sunday night. Annie Tse Yau On-yee, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, warned the protests would hurt sales and even the city’s reputation as a safe destination. Tse said the industry body expected retail sales to dip this year, as political unrest lingers. “We are concerned about the safety of retail staff. When shops are closed, of course, businesses will be affected. This is a very direct [impact],” she said. “It’s not just about Yuen Long. The same goes in other districts with protests.” “Initially, Hong Kong is seen as a very safe place and a shopping paradise.

"Hong Kong police to launch raids on white-clad thugs, including members of 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs, who unleashed terror on protesters and bystanders in Yuen Long","Force preparing major arrest operation against mob carrying metal rods and sticks who targeted protesters and passengers at MTR station and beyond; List of dozens of suspects includes faction leader of notorious gang, with raids expected to start on Monday and last for days","8:08pm, 22 Jul, 2019","Force insiders told the Post they believed more than 100 attackers wielding wooden sticks and metal rods, including members of the 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs, were involved in terrorising protesters and passers-by on Sunday night, following a mass anti-government march.; Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor hit out on Monday afternoon at the “shocking” violence in Yuen Long, and said she had requested the police commissioner left no stone unturned in arresting attackers.","Police were set to launch a series of raids in Hong Kong on Monday night to arrest the white-clad men behind mob violence in Yuen Long, which left at least 45 people injured. “We have a list of suspects in connection with the violent attacks. Anti-triad officers will soon launch an arrest operation in the district,” one source said on Monday. The dozens of assailants identified by police in connection with the rampant attack in Yuen Long MTR station included a Wo Shing Wo faction leader, whose nickname is “Yat Poon Tsai”, according to the source. He was said to hold the rank of “red-pole fighter”, a senior triad member who acts as an enforcer. The other suspect, whose alias is “Dou Kai Hok”, is a village head in Yuen Long, who is believed to be a 14K triad member. The source said officers would raid entertainment venues controlled by gangsters in Yuen Long, adding “the operation will begin on Monday night and last for several days”. The Post was told that an attempt to set up a Lennon Wall in Yuen Long might have sparked the violence. The walls in public spaces are decorated with messages and drawings in support of anti-government demonstrations. The source said there were several outbreaks of conflict between Yuen Long gangsters and extradition bill protesters last week. “Yuen Long gangsters had warned that they would give protesters a lesson if they dared to come again,” he said. The source said Sunday’s violence was organised, as hundreds of gangsters wearing white T-shirts gathered in the evening, hours before clashes erupted in different areas of the district. The force was criticised for their response to the rampaging mob, with residents complaining that officers took too long to arrive, and when they did make it to the scene, the attackers had already fled. On Sunday, at least 45 people including Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting were injured in the series of assaults and fights at different locations of Yuen Long district. The most serious attack took place in Yuen Long MTR station at about 10.45pm, when a gang of men wearing white T-shirts used wooden sticks and metal rods to beat their targets, who were mostly extradition bill protesters. Some of the most savage violence was seen when they stormed into a train carriage to attack passengers. When two officers arrived at the scene seven minutes later, the pair made the assessment they did not have enough protective gear, so decided not to intervene and instead called for backup. The attackers fled before police reinforcements of more than 30 officers arrived at the station at 11.20pm. But the mob returned to the station to launch a second round of attacks at around midnight, by forcing open entrances that had been closed. Witnesses said there were no officers in sight. The source said officers were deployed to other locations at the time, including a confrontation between more than 200 extradition bill protesters in black T-shirts and white-clad men at the entrance of nearby Nam Pin Wai village. The two sides had left the area by 3am on Monday. No arrests were made at the scene.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019637/hong-kong-police-launch-raids-white-clad-thugs
Hong Kong press associations ‘strongly condemn’ attacks on journalists at Yuen Long MTR station,"At least four local journalists attacked by white-clad mob on Sunday, including a woman who was beaten while filming live; Media groups denounce violence as ‘serious threat to freedom of press and speech’ – and call on police to deliver justice","7:23pm, 22 Jul, 2019","Local journalists groups on Monday issued statements denouncing the mob of men in white T-shirts who attacked black-clad protesters and passengers with rods and canes at Yuen Long MTR station late on Sunday night. At least 45 people were injured, according to the Hospital Authority.; According to local media reports, at least four Hong Kong journalists were attacked by the white-clad mob. Two of the victims were reportedly from Apple Daily, the Chinese newspaper, and one each from the Stand News website and Now TV, the cable broadcaster.; The club said its board members would meet members of the HKJA to discuss ways to defend media freedom in Hong Kong. The FCC also called for an independent investigation of all violence directed at journalists by police since the start of the extradition bill protests last month.","Hong Kong press associations have condemned the late-night attack on passengers and journalists at a railway station that left at least four reporters injured. Members of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong said they were planning to hold a silent protest on Tuesday outside the FCC building in Central under the banner “Yes to press freedom, no to violence against journalists”. A joint statement issued on Monday by the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association and the Independent Commentators Association, made an urgent appeal to the local police to protect citizens and journalists. “The assault on journalists constitutes a severe infringement of press freedom and the public’s right to know, and hinders [journalists] from fulfilling their duty as the fourth estate,” the statement read. “We strongly condemn such violent acts and demand the police arrest the attackers still at large.” Stand News reported that one of its women journalists was attacked while doing a live online report. The news outlet said her hands and right shoulder were hurt and she suffered swelling on the back of her head. Video footage from Stand News appeared to show the reporter being assaulted while shooting a video of the white-clad mob attacking people. In the video, she was beaten several times before being pushed to the ground. A woman’s scream could be heard a few times and a male voice repeatedly shouted: “Stop! Do not beat the reporter!” Now TV reported that its cameraman at the MTR station was attacked with canes by several men in white shirts. His video camera was snatched and thrown outside the station, according to the broadcaster, leaving it “completely shattered”. The Hong Kong News Executives’ Association issued a statement on Monday that “strongly condemned” the mob attack in Yuen Long that left reporters injured. The association also urged the police to follow up the attack in accordance with the law. “Covering a news event is a journalist’s duty. Because of the work of journalists, the public is able to understand the truth,” the statement said. “To blatantly attack or threaten journalists who are reporting is a serious threat to freedom of press and speech.” The FCC, in its statement, “expressed solidarity” with the injured journalists. It called on Hong Kong police and authorities to “urgently find and bring to justice those who carried out the unprecedented mob attack”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019629/hong-kong-press-associations-strongly-condemn-attacks
"Pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho defends white-clad mob that attacked civilians in Hong Kong MTR station, says they can be ‘pardoned for defending their home’","Attack is a normal reaction to protesters who brought violence to peaceful community, says rural leader and pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho; Law Society receives complaints, says matter is being looked into","6:21pm, 22 Jul, 2019","A pro-Beijing lawmaker on Monday defended the white-clad men who indiscriminately attacked civilians in Yuen Long on Sunday night, saying they were merely “defending their home and people”.; On Sunday night, anti-extradition protesters clashed with police in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong Island – some 29km from Yuen Long.","While Junius Ho Kwan-yiu distanced himself from the assault, he said: “The sinners can be pardoned.” The rural leader is in hot water after he was filmed shaking hands with men in white clothes and thanking them on Sunday night. But it was unclear what he was thanking them for. His defence for the white-clad men, made at a press conference at noon on Monday, further enraged the extradition bill protesters. Within hours, a group of them had broken the glass walls of his empty office in Tsuen Wan. The Law Society, of which Ho was once president, said it was “seriously looking” into calls for disciplinary action against the lawmaker for bringing disrepute to the legal profession. Men dressed in white T-shirts were seen bashing travellers inside Yuen Long MTR station on Sunday night. Among those attacked were protesters returning from another anti-government march opposing the now-suspended extradition bill in the heart of the city’s financial district on Hong Kong Island. At least 45 people were sent to hospital as a result of the attack, which happened at about 10.45pm. Speaking to media on Monday, Ho admitted meeting men in white clothes at about 10pm on Sunday, saying some of them were his friends. “Some of them I know, some are village chiefs, teachers, shop owners and car mechanics,” Ho said. He said it was a coincidence that he was in the neighbourhood. “I live in Yuen Long, so it is normal for me to be there,” Ho said. He distanced himself from the attacks, but said the incidents were a “normal reaction to protesters who brought violence to the peaceful community after they stormed the liaison office”. “We can’t pardon the sin, but we can pardon the sinners,” Ho said. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the protesters after they started throwing bricks and glass bottles at officers. Ho ruled out having known about the Yuen Long attack beforehand, or having “conspired” in it, but said: “These white-clad men had already said they would drive the mob in black away if the latter dared to come to Yuen Long.” He was referring to the extradition bill protesters, many of whom wore black. Ho also blamed Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting for “leading protesters to Yuen Long”. Lam was among those attacked on Sunday night, and was seen bleeding from his mouth. The Democrat was rushed to hospital, where he got stitches. About 100 protesters showed up outside Ho’s office at around 3pm on Monday. Some stuck notes outside the empty office. The notes called Ho “galactic scum” and alleged he had triad links. Others sprayed profanities on the glass and stuck a large banner outside the office. “Rural thugs beat people up; the government and police shelter them,” it read. At 4.52pm, the protesters broke all glass walls in Ho’s office. The premises were strewn with shards of glass, egg shells and papers. The vandals drew devil horns on a portrait of Ho. It was unclear whether they took anything away. A young male protester, who wished to remain unnamed, said Ho failed to clear his association with the attackers. “He condemned the [extradition] protesters, but after last night he said the lawbreakers could be forgiven,” he said. Meanwhile, the Law Society said it would follow up on the complaints against Ho for bringing disrepute to the profession. “The Law Society is seriously looking into the matter and conducting reviews on relevant complaints, and will pass the matter to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal if necessary,” the professional body said. “Due to the confidentiality of the investigation process, the Law Society will not comment on the matter at this stage.” Society president Melissa Pang said the body had received “quite a number of complaints” but would not comment on Ho’s behaviour. “One must look at the whole context,” Pang said.

No police officer was in sight as the rod-wielding mob hurled objects at passers-by and assaulted them; Also on Sunday night, the heart of Hong Kong’s business district was turned into a war zone as riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of protesters to chase them off the streets, after a day of defiance during which the demonstrators laid siege to Beijing’s liaison office for the first time during recent social unrest over the now-suspended extradition bill.","Hong Kong’s leader on Monday hit out at “shocking” violence in Yuen Long the night before, and the siege of the central government’s office in the city by protesters who defaced the building facade and national emblem. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor met the press with her full team of top officials as well as Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung on Monday afternoon, after a night of unprecedented violence in the city. She strongly condemned the attacks in Yuen Long, which she described as shocking, and pledged police would fully investigate them. “Violence is not a solution to any problem. Violence will only breed more violence,” Lam said. “We absolutely do not tolerate such violence.” She said the attackers had shown complete disregard for the city’s laws and offered her sympathy to those injured. Lam said the attackers “completely disregarded the law”. “Their behaviour was infuriating,” she added. “We absolutely do not allow or tolerate such behaviour. I have already requested the police commissioner spare no effort in arresting the attackers.” The police force faced a barrage of criticism for failing to stop the rampaging mob. Residents complained that officers took too long to arrive and that, when they did arrive, the attackers had already fled. Lam dismissed as “completely groundless” accusations that police colluded with the suspected triad members, saying they were an attempt by her critics to undermine the administration.  The embattled leader added that her determination to run the city, and that of her officials, had been unwavering despite the criticism of recent months. Commissioner Lo said at the press conference that police got a call about the Yuen Long violence at 10.45pm on Sunday. When two officers arrived at the scene seven minutes later, they realised they did not have enough protective gear and so decided to call for help. More officers arrived at 11.20pm. “The police seriously condemn the violence. We do not allow such violent behaviour,” Lo said, adding that officers would look into gathering evidence as soon as possible and make arrests. Lo admitted police manpower had been stretched due to a series of extradition bill protests since last month. “Every time there is a major event which may lead to violent confrontations, we have to redeploy some of our manpower in various districts to Hong Kong Island so I can ensure sufficient manpower to deal with these incidents,” he said. He categorically denied the alleged collusion between his officers and the Yuen Long attackers. Asked why some police stations near the MTR station shut their doors on Sunday night, Lo said it was for safety reasons because big groups of protesters were surrounding them. He said the public could still reach the police by calling 999. Protesters were angry at Lam’s remarks that the legislation was “dead”, demanding a complete withdrawal. On the unrest outside the liaison office on Sunday night, Lam criticised the defacement of the national emblem on the front of the building, and said the protesters were challenging the country’s sovereignty and the principle of “one country, two systems”, under which Beijing promises the city a high degree of autonomy. “We will seriously follow up on this and pursue it in accordance with the law,” she said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019585/hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-lam-blasts-violence
"Hong Kong police deny accusation they colluded with thugs who attacked passengers at train station, as one lawmaker calls incident ‘terrorism’",Protesters question why it took officers so long to arrive at site of violent attacks and want to know why no one was arrested; Chief Superintendent John Tse says delay does not equal collusion and numbers involved meant first police on scene had to wait for backup,"3:26pm, 22 Jul, 2019","On Sunday night, at least 45 people were injured as suspected triad gangsters stormed into Yuen Long MTR station and attacked people inside. No police officer was in sight as the rod-wielding mob hurled objects at passers-by and assaulted them; Also on Sunday night, the heart of Hong Kong’s business district was turned into a war zone as riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of protesters to chase them off the streets, after a day of defiance during which the demonstrators laid siege to Beijing’s liaison office for the first time during recent social unrest over the now-suspended extradition bill.","Hong Kong’s embattled police force faced a barrage of criticism on Monday for failing to stop a rampaging mob of men, who attacked anti-government protesters and terrorised passengers at a train station on Sunday night. About 30 protesters demonstrated at a police station in northern Hong Kong on Monday, and accused officers of colluding with those who carried out the attack. Hundreds of social workers later marched on the same Yuen Long station to hand over what they said was criminal evidence of gang members assaulting residents, and to lodge police misconduct complaints. They were accompanied on the march by 30 officers, as requested by the demonstrators, who feared being attacked. The groups claimed police failed to act in a timely manner when scores of thugs dressed in white T-shirts descended into Yuen Long MTR station and attacked passengers, especially those in black T-shirts. It is believed they wanted to target those who were on their way home from the extradition bill march in Causeway Bay earlier that day. Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung, head of the police public relations bureau, denied the accusations, despite it taking officers more than half an hour to arrive at the scene. “I cannot agree. Just because we were not at the scene right away, doesn’t mean we colluded with any party,” he said in a radio programme. The earlier protest at the police station in Yuen Long was organised by pan-democratic lawmakers and district councillors, who accused police of turning a blind eye to the violence, and handed in a letter that outlined their grievances. Yuen Long District commander Lee Wai-man, who received the letter, said police had been unable to keep up with the number of 999 calls they received about the incident. “We will do our utmost to keep residents safe,” he said, and added that the force had not received any intelligence regarding any fresh attacks on Monday. Pan-democratic lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, representing New Territories West, was critical of the police response and failure to keep residents safe. “Police didn’t show up while thugs rampaged through the station and attacked Yuen Long residents indiscriminately last night,” he said. “There is clear collusion between police and the gangs.” Legislator Roy Kwong Chun-yu, who also represents the local district, described events in Yuen Long as a “lawless situation”. “Some said it was terrorism, I don’t think that’s an exaggeration at all,” he said. “It took the firefighters only six minutes to come to the scene after taking the call. Why did the police sit on their hands?” MTR Corporation, management at Yoho shopping centre, which is next to the station, and some witnesses said police did not respond in a timely fashion. Yoho Mall, where some of the attacks took place, said it tried to report the incident to police, but they could not be reached. The centre said residents eventually helped take care of the injured, and provided them with water and first aid. Alan Cheng Kwan-hing, the rail operator’s chief of operating, said in a separate radio programme on Monday that the corporation had contacted police at 10.47pm, but it took officers some time to arrive at Yuen Long station. “I was anxiously waiting for the police,” said Cheng, who said he had been in the Tsing Yi control room. He added that MTR staff had sought help again, even after reporting the matter to police. Two major rounds of fights broke out at Yuen Long station, before 11pm and again near midnight. In the last round of fighting, thugs broke through an entrance gate, chased after passengers and attacked them with rods and rattan canes. Tse believed the incidents stemmed from a clash between groups that held different political views. He said police received calls for help at 10.45pm, and two officers arrived at scene in seven minutes. The pair were seen leaving the scene when the attacks took place. Tse said the officers found about 100 people were fighting, and requested more help because of the large number of people involved. “While waiting for extra manpower, the two officers stayed outside the station for their own safety and evaluated the situation. This is an appropriate decision,” he said. Even though the pair were equipped with guns, Tse said it was riskier to use them because of the size of the crowd. More officers arrived at the station over half an hour later at 11.20pm, because at the same time other officers were dealing with fights and fires elsewhere, he said. After midnight, the police arrived at Nam Pin Wai village near the station, where there were two groups of people confronting each other, including some in white T-shirts. Tse said the police could not ascertain if those in white T-shirts had been involved in the violence at the station, and no arrests were made. “The police will arrest suspects when evidence warrants it,” he said. A witness said a pregnant woman was also chased, and used her body to protect her partner from the thugs, but there were no police officers around for protection. “I was calming her down as she was frightened and had breathing problem after she lost contact with the partner in the station,” the witness said. “Why did the gang in white T-shirts even target pregnant women?” The social worker march on Monday afternoon started at Long Ping MTR and ended at Yuen Long police station. “We are exercising our legal right as citizens of Hong Kong to report crimes. It is the police’s responsibility to protect us social workers in doing so,” said Lun Chi-wai, president of Hong Kong Social Workers’ General Union. Lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, also a registered social worker, said: “We social workers have to abide by our professional standards to protect people and tell the truth. That’s why we demand police to investigate what went wrong last night.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019574/hong-kong-police-deny-accusation-they-colluded-thugs-who
"Top Beijing representative in Hong Kong condemns attack on liaison office during extradition protest, says rioters will be punished","Radical protesters offended all Chinese people and challenged central government’s authority, said director of Beijing’s liaison office Wang Zhimin; He praised those who took part in pro-establishment rallies on June 30 and July 20","2:09pm, 22 Jul, 2019","In a rare personal statement in front of the cameras on Monday, liaison office director Wang Zhimin said he was confident the “rioters” who pelted the liaison office building in Western District with eggs and paintballs would be punished by local authorities.; While Wang said his office would continue to serve Hong Kong people, he did not touch on Sunday night’s savage attacks on protesters and passengers by a mob of men wearing white at Yuen Long MTR station.","Beijing’s top official in Hong Kong has slammed Sunday’s unprecedented attack on his office by anti-government protesters who defaced the national emblem on the building front, saying their radical actions had offended all Chinese people. “Last night, some people with extreme ideas besieged the liaison office, while a minority of them threw eggs and black paintballs to deface our stately national emblem,” he said. “They destroyed our security facilities, and wrote words to insult the nation and national integrity … The liaison office and various sectors in Hong Kong issue strongest condemnation of such acts.” Wang said he firmly believed the Hong Kong government, police and judiciary would “strictly punish and go all the way after the accused”. “The recent intense protests in Hong Kong completely went beyond the limits of peaceful demonstration. Some protesters publicly challenged the bottom line of the city’s rule of law, the authority of the constitution and the Basic Law, as well as the central government’s authority, sovereignty, national security, dignity and symbols,” he said. “These damaged the spirit of the rule of law in Hong Kong, the interest of the local people, and seriously hurt the feelings of all Chinese people, including 7 million Hongkongers.” Wang believed various sectors in Hong Kong would “absolutely not agree” with what the protesters did. “Last night, members of the liaison office staff, just like many Hong Kong residents, were deeply shocked and angered,” he said. “But we have put up a new national emblem to show that as the sun rises this morning, the stately national emblem would still be hung outside our building, which is still unmoved and located on the harbourfront.” Wang said the liaison office would “not let people down” as it continued to perform its duties, such as firmly supporting the city’s government and law enforcement agencies in maintaining public order. He said he appreciated those who took part in the pro-establishment camp’s rallies on June 30 and July 20, and said he had received a lot of messages supporting the liaison office since Sunday night. In a statement issued on Sunday, a spokesman for the liaison office said the protesters’ act touched on the bottom line of Beijing’s “one country, two systems” principle on Hong Kong. Lawmaker Leung Che-cheung, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said the liaison office was referring to China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong. “We have ‘one country’ first, before we have ‘two systems’. When they were defacing the symbol of the country, they were saying they didn’t want ‘one country, two systems’ and only wanted Hong Kong’s independence,” Leung said. “But Beijing would not allow them to challenge the nation’s security like that.” Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lawmaker Michael Luk Chung-hung echoed Leung’s view. “The bottom line of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle was the central government’s sovereignty over Hong Kong … Beijing would not abandon the principle or adopt ‘one country, one system’, but we still need to respect the central government so that the principle can work well,” he added. In a joint statement issued on Monday, the pro-Beijing camp said when protesters were laying siege to the liaison office, they defaced the emblem, tried to storm the building, and chanted slogans about staging a revolution to “reclaim” Hong Kong. “These acts seriously contravened the national constitution, destroyed Hong Kong’s social order, and harmed the people’s interest,” the statement read.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019556/top-beijing-representative-hong-kong-condemns-attack

Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily ran a commentary on its front page, while news agency Xinhua led its website with a commentary that was also carried on the front page of People’s Liberation Army Daily, the military’s mouthpiece. The commentaries followed the statement by Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Sunday night, which criticised “some radical demonstrators” for vandalising the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong, saying it had “touched the bottom line of the principle of ‘one country, two systems’” and was “absolutely intolerable”. Derogatory graffiti was written on the liaison office building, while the national emblem was defaced by protesters with black paint. Police dispersed protesters late on Sunday. People’s Daily said “the besieging of the Central Liaison Office building has already exceeded peaceful demonstration” and “those violent acts have seriously breached Hong Kong’s Basic Law [the city’s mini-constitution] and other local laws”. “One cannot find any excuse for violence!” the commentary said, adding that mutual respect and peaceful and rational expression of opinions were basic requirements of a civilised society. “To compromise with, defend, beautify and condone violence would only fuel escalated violent acts of extremists,” it said. The similar Xinhua commentary, reproduced by PLA Daily, said the actions of radical demonstrators represented a blatant challenge to the central government’s authority. “It has made a very bad impact and must not be tolerated,” it said. “It must be strongly condemned and criminals should be punished according to law.” Global Times, the hawkish tabloid, warned in its editorial that openly challenging Beijing’s authority “would never come to a good end”. “A small mob is determined to make enemies with the country and they tried every means to create brutal clashes,” it said. “Their final aim is to completely disorder Hong Kong.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3019555/chinese-state-media-condemns-hong-kong-protesters-after
"With Beijing a direct target, has Hong Kong reached a ‘new normal’ as violent protests escalate?","No endgame in sight as street mayhem spirals, warns political observer, while survey reveals overwhelming majority of protesters sympathetic to violence; Worrying shift as protesters target Beijing’s liaison office for first time, says another academic, who suggests independent inquiry could defuse tensions","10:00am, 22 Jul, 2019","After tense clashes between protesters and police on Sunday night that left streets blanketed in tear gas and buildings defaced by expletives heaped at the central government, political watchers saw no endgame in sight, with one warning Hong Kong was entering a “new normal” on how it viewed law and order.; The protests over the now-suspended extradition bill have become a weekly affair, but on Sunday night the demonstrations descended to an unprecedented level of mayhem as protesters trained their sights on the central government.; The procession was earlier ordered by the police to end at Southorn Playground in Wan Chai but many demonstrators defied the order and marched westwards towards the city centre, targeting not just the liaison office but also the central and western police stations.; “It is still far from what’s happened in France,” he said, referring to the “yellow vest” protesters who have been demonstrating for several months every weekend.","An academic also revealed a survey conducted on the marchers who took part in the Sunday protest found that 80 per cent of 1,000 people polled said they understood why protesters would resort to violence. They were left with little choice given the government inaction, those surveyed said. Just before nightfall, protesters who had begun their march at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay splintered into different directions to occupy main roads in Central while others advanced towards the liaison office in Western district to pelt the building with eggs, deface the national emblem and spray paint the walls with expletives against Beijing. After hours of a stand-off with defiant protesters, groups of whom brandished metal poles and bricks, the police fired several rounds of tear gas after repeated warnings. Edmund Cheng Wai, a Baptist University political scientist, noted the growing trend of the escalation of protesters’ actions, usually at the end of peaceful marches over the past few weeks. “Occupation of roads has become new normal of peaceful protests as protests went on, which is a sign of defiance of law and order,” he said. “On Sunday, many protesters saw the police’s demand that the march ended at Southorn Playground as an unreasonable restriction.” Echoing Cheng’s views, a government source said “now many people don’t see the occupation of roads as a big problem”. “It poses a huge challenge for the police,” the source said. Cheng, who has been on the ground to observe the protesters since the protests erupted last month, said the boundary of what was lawful had become blurred among a growing number of people, including those who were not involved in the violence. He noted a substantial proportion of marchers endorsed the escalation in light of the government’s failure to respond to protesters’ demands, even as they stayed away from committing any forceful acts themselves. He and several academics from Chinese University and the Lingnan University have been conducting surveys among people who took part in the July 1 march, and the protest in Sha Tin on July 14. They conducted similar surveys with marchers who took to streets on Sunday. “We found that more than 80 per cent who took part in Sunday’s march agreed that it is understandable protesters take radical action if the government is bent on going its own way. The findings are similar to those in the previous marches,” Cheng said. Sunday marked the third mass protest organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, following the marches of June 9 and 16 which it said had attracted 1 and 2 million protesters respectively. While Sunday’s march was much smaller, with an estimated 430,000 people taking to the streets, the intensity of the battles with police heightened as more remained on the streets after the march was supposed to end. Sunday’s mayhem followed violent clashes on June 12 when protesters surrounded the legislature and on July 1 when they stormed the building. Protesters also clashed with police in suburban areas Sheung Shui and Sha Tin on previous weekends. At least 48 people were injured when violent conflict broke out in Hong Kong’s northern town of Sha Tin on the night of July 14. Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University, said he saw no endgame in sight as he expected it to become a persistent campaign, such as the Yellow Vests movement in France. “The anti-bill protests are spontaneous, unpredictable and would wear the police out,” he said, adding such an approach would continue to give the government problems to restore law and order. “Lam’s administration has hinted it would not respond to the protesters’ demands and has hoped to drag it out. It is proven that such tactics have not dampened the movement but instead provoke even more people.” Ma said ordering an independent inquiry to look into the police’s use of force – one of the protesters’ demands – might not dissolve the crisis once and for all, but it could help reduce the tension. “Some protesters might want to stop too but there’s no reason for now to do so,” he said. But Ma said the city was still far from a breakdown in law and order in light of the latest development, as he noted most of the protests were still peaceful. Cheng said the protesters still stick to some boundaries, such as not storming private properties nor targeting retail outlets of luxury goods. “Up to now, protesters only target at the government and police,” he said. But he said it was worrying that protesters were now shifting their targets to the facilities of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong. “The stakes and risks are becoming higher as Beijing sees such moves as a challenge to national sovereignty,” he said, referring to their attack of the liaison office building. Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu urged the government to respond to the protesters’ calls as he admitted pro-democracy lawmakers’ hands were tied. “The pan-democrats acknowledge in this new era of movement, we are not the leaders and politicians cannot take up the role of leaders like they did in the old days,” he said. “The political matter can only be resolved politically.” A source from the pro-democracy bloc, who asked not to be named, also questioned what he described as the police’s “incomprehensible” strategy. “If they have rigidly ordered the march to end in Wan Chai, then why would they allow the protesters to easily advance as if they are inviting people to breach the line?” he said. “Do they want to prevent escalated protests, crush or make mass arrests? We have no idea what they are planning.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019520/has-hong-kong-reached-new-normal-law-and-order-after-fresh
"At least 45 injured as rod-wielding mob dressed in white rampages through Yuen Long MTR station, beating screaming protesters","Blood smeared on floor in chilling attacks against demonstrators on train and around station; By 7am, at least 45 people had been sent to hospital or had sought treatment, according to the Hospital Authority","3:04am, 22 Jul, 2019","A live video clip shows passengers on board a train screaming in fear as a group of armed men in white wave their rods at them at Yuen Long MTR station. pic.twitter.com/0htLQeKErF; — Stella Lee (@StellaLeeHKnews) July 21, 2019; BREAKING: A video clip circulated online shows a group of men in white beat other passengers at Yuen Long MTR station. pic.twitter.com/YsNuhN2FUK; — Stella Lee (@StellaLeeHKnews) July 21, 2019","At least 45 people were injured in unprecedented late-night violence at a Hong Kong railway station on Sunday, as a rampaging mob of men in white T-shirts attacked black-clad protesters and passengers indiscriminately. No police officer was in sight as dozens of men, who witnesses suggested were triad gangsters, stormed into Yuen Long MTR station at around midnight by forcing open closed entrances. They hurled objects at protesters and travellers alike, and assaulted members of the public, including journalists. Some people protected themselves with umbrellas, while others tried to fight back by hurling helmets at them. By the time riot police arrived, local residents were furious and accused them of deliberately letting the assailants run wild. By 7am, at least 45 people had been sent to one of four nearby hospitals or had sought treatment there themselves, according to the Hospital Authority. Trains had been bypassing the station since 11pm because of a previous rampage by the same or a similar mob of men in white T-shirts attacking protesters returning from another anti-government mass march against the now-suspended extradition bill in the heart of the city’s financial district. While protesters in Wan Chai, Central and Sheung Wan were facing off with riot police, at around 10.30pm, the attackers ran onto trains, using rods to attack passengers and go after anyone wearing black, witnesses said. The government condemned the attacks in a statement released after midnight. The statement said: “In Yuen Long, some people congregated at the platforms of the MTR station and train compartments, attacking commuters. It led to confrontations and injuries.” It continued: “This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law. The [government] strongly condemns any violence and will seriously take enforcement actions.” Stunning video clips circulating online and played on television screens captured the chaos and terror as passengers scrambled for cover. Among the injured was opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who was bleeding from his face, and a female reporter with injuries on her arm. Police officers, who arrived at the station at 11.15pm, when the mob was gone, were surrounded by dozens of angry residents and protesters. “Where have you been? You are supposed to protect us!” they shouted, expressing their anger with expletives. One man, who was attacked at the station during the midnight invasion, accused police of deliberately retreating after being called to the scene for the first assault. At about 1am, as many as 100 riot police arrived at Nam Pin Wai village, where most of the men dressed in white shirts had gathered. But after blocking entrances to the village for more than three hours, the police had only briefly questioned several of the white-clad men. No one was arrested, but several steel bars were confiscated. Officers have refused to respond to queries. In an early morning press conference, police officials said they saw no steel rods in the village and noticed nothing criminal. “We have not made any arrests because we can’t be sure of those involved,” said Yau Nai-keung, assistant commander of Yuen Long District. “Even those dressed in white, that doesn’t mean they are involved in the brawl. We will handle each case fairly – no matter the political camp [a suspect] belongs to.” Three press watchdog groups strongly condemned the assault on two journalists at Yuen Long station. Both were reportedly beaten with weapons, including by wooden rods, leaving one female reporter hospitalised. “We urgently appeal to the police to perform their duty and protect the people and journalists,” said a joint statement by the Hong Kong Journalists Association, the Press Photographers Association and Independent Commentators Association. An MTR spokesman said workers at the station saw disputes taking place at about 10.45pm. Staff members immediately reported the situation to the operations control centre, which contacted police within two minutes. Fighting then broke out on the station concourse and the fire alarm was triggered. At 10.56pm, the control centre arranged for West Rail Line trains of both directions not to stop at Yuen Long and also tried to arrange trains to pick up passengers there. The control centre arranged for trains to resume stops at Yuen Long from 11.19pm. “MTR Corporation strongly condemns the violence that occurred on railway premises last night. We will fully cooperate with the law enforcement authorities on the investigation,” MTR Corp’s chief executive Jacob Kam Chak-pui said in a statement. In a video circulated online, pro-establishment lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu was seen shaking hands with men in white T-shirts lining up on Fung Yau Street East. He was unavailable for comment by publishing time. But in a video he posted on his Facebook page early on Monday morning, Ho, who lives in Yuen Long, said he came across the group of men in white shirts on the street and took a picture with them. He said he knew some of them and regarded all as “chivalrous men” who safeguarded their homes.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019524/least-10-injured-baton-wielding-mob-suspected-triad
Former Hong Kong leader C Y Leung tells younger generation to become ‘good’ people to seize opportunities from Beijing’s Greater Bay Area economic master plan,"Failure of young people to develop decent character risks inflicting damage on wider society, says ex-chief executive; Leung makes comments as youngsters feature prominently in another mass anti-government march on Sunday, demanding full withdrawal of extradition bill","10:53pm, 21 Jul, 2019","The former chief executive’s comments came as an organiser estimate of 430,000 demonstrators, including many young people, took to the streets on Sunday in yet another protest against the government’s handling of the now-suspended extradition bill.; While Leung had not mentioned the crisis triggered by the extradition bill row, his predecessor Tung Chee-hwa blamed the recent protest violence partly on the teaching of liberal studies at secondary schools.","Former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying has urged the younger generation to focus on being “good” people to avoid damaging society, as he blamed schools and parents for not doing enough to support their development as citizens. Leung, now a vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the nation’s top advisory body, was questioned during a book launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair in Wan Chai on Sunday about how young people could take advantage of opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a central government scheme to link Hong Kong, Macau and nine Guangdong cities. In his response, he blamed schools and parents for being too busy and not teaching children how to be a decent person. “You first learn to be a human, before doing anything else,” he said. “Regardless of how capable a person is, if he does not learn to be a human, he is not a good man and will cause great harm to society. “The more capable he is, the more harmful he is to society.” However, critics have said the government’s lack of communication with young people was at the heart of the bill crisis. In the wake of escalating protests, the administration pledged to promote a new governance style, which involved listening more to members of the public from all walks of life. The now-suspended extradition bill would have allowed Hong Kong to transfer suspects to jurisdictions with which it lacked extradition agreements, including mainland China. The controversy has triggered a series of mass protests, sieges of police headquarters and the storming of the Legislative Council since early June. A march in Sha Tin last Sunday ended in bloody clashes between protesters and police, leaving 28 people injured including 13 officers.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019517/former-hong-kong-leader-c-y-leung-tells-younger-generation
"Two of three men arrested over Hong Kong’s biggest bomb plot, discovered on eve of major anti-government protest, are members of pro-independence groups","Those arrested include members of Hong Kong National Front and Hong Kong Independence Union, which deny any knowledge of plot; Powerful explosives found at industrial building in Tsuen Wan, as well as 10 petrol bombs and anti-extradition bill material","9:24pm, 21 Jul, 2019","The former chief executive’s comments came as an organiser estimate of 430,000 demonstrators, including many young people, took to the streets on Sunday in yet another protest against the government’s handling of the now-suspended extradition bill.; While Leung had not mentioned the crisis triggered by the extradition bill row, his predecessor Tung Chee-hwa blamed the recent protest violence partly on the teaching of liberal studies at secondary schools.","At least two of the three men arrested at the weekend over the city’s biggest bomb plot are members of different pro-independence groups, suggesting there could have been collaboration across the movement, it emerged on Sunday. Both groups have denied knowledge of the explosives found at an industrial building in Tsuen Wan, with one of them labelling the arrest as political suppression, saying their organisation never had any plans to use bombs. A 27-year-old man, surnamed Lo, was arrested on Friday night at Lung Shing Factory Building in Texaco Road, following a police raid that led to the discovery of 10 petrol bombs and about 2kg of the powerful explosive triacetone triperoxide – the largest seizure of its type by the force since the return of the city from Britain to China in 1997. While Lo was a member of Hong Kong National Front, one of the two 25-year-olds arrested on Saturday night, surnamed Tang, belonged to Hong Kong Independence Union. Tang was arrested at his Fanling home while the third suspect, surnamed Hau, was arrested at his residence in Tsuen Wan. Wayne Chan Ka-kui, convenor of the union, confirmed on Sunday that Tang was one of its members and was still being held by police to assist in investigations. “We never had any plans to resort to explosives. I would say it is a political suppression,” Chan said. The group also issued a post on social media, saying: “We would not be scared by even more arrests.” A police spokesman said the three, who were still detained as of Sunday evening, were arrested for possession of explosives without licence. The pair arrested on Saturday night were understood to be closely associated with Lo, who reportedly rented the unit. Disqualified lawmaker Sixtus Baggio Leung Chung-hang, Hong Kong National Front’s spokesman, said the industrial unit was used to store acoustic equipment and other promotional materials and denied any knowledge of the explosives. He confirmed that Lo had contacted them for assistance and they would speak further after their member was out on bail. Leung said he reported earlier this year to police that their storage room in Sha Tsui Road, Tsuen Wan, was broken into and some flags were stolen ahead of the annual New Year’s Day march. Among the seizures on Friday were knives, catapults, helmets, face masks and goggles. Other items uncovered were Hong Kong National Front T-shirts, leaflets bearing the message “no extradition to China” and pamphlets promoting the June 9 extradition march. A police source said detectives were still investigating the source of the explosives and what they were intended for. Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah, of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau, said on Saturday that the industrial unit had been rented out for a few months and they would investigate whether the seizure was related to the recent extradition bill march. The Hong Kong Independence Union was founded last year, while Hong Kong National Front, which Leung said had dozens of members, was founded in 2015. The front has proposed “building Hong Kong nationality, retaking our rights of self-determination”. In 2016, a few party members waving banners carrying the words “Hong Kong is not China” dashed to the stage of the June 4 candlelight vigil at Victoria Park, chanting “Hong Kong Independence”. The group had also worked with another pro-independence group Student Localism to distribute pamphlets outside schools to promote independence. It was one of the several groups advocating independence in Hong Kong, with many turning low profile after the most prominent group, Hong Kong National Party, was banned in 2018. Leung, founder of localist group Youngspiration, joined the Hong Kong National Front as its spokesman after the unprecedented ban in September 2018, saying he wanted to do more as he predicted that independence groups could only “go underground”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019513/two-three-men-arrested-over-hong-kongs-biggest-bomb
China state media takes aim at ‘violent extremists’ in Hong Kong,Minority with ‘evil intentions’ using protest chaos to undermine Chinese development; Xinhua mentions ‘external forces’ but People’s Daily does not,"7:27pm, 21 Jul, 2019","The former chief executive’s comments came as an organiser estimate of 430,000 demonstrators, including many young people, took to the streets on Sunday in yet another protest against the government’s handling of the now-suspended extradition bill.; While Leung had not mentioned the crisis triggered by the extradition bill row, his predecessor Tung Chee-hwa blamed the recent protest violence partly on the teaching of liberal studies at secondary schools.","China’s main official news outlets have accused “extremists” of using the “chaos” and violence in Hong Kong to disrupt the country’s development in commentaries published late on Saturday, ahead of the latest rally against the now-suspended extradition bill on Sunday afternoon. The tone of the commentaries – by Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily and state news agency Xinhua – focused on the need for protesters to avoid violence and followed a day of pro-Beijing, pro-police rallies in Hong Kong which organisers said drew 316,000 people on Saturday. Police estimated 103,000 attended at the peak of the event. The pro-Beijing rally was dubbed “Safeguard Hong Kong” by organisers and denounced the violence used by some protesters against police over the weeks of demonstrations. “A minority of people harbouring evil intentions, and external forces, not only never condemn the violence, but defend acts of violence … Under their agitation and conniving, violence by extremists has escalated,” Xinhua said. “The mobs and the people behind them do not hesitate to undermine the peaceful life of citizens, and block the future development of the city … what they want to do is nothing less than to paralyse the [Special Administrative Region] government, undermine ‘one country, two systems’, struggle for governing control of the SAR, and to use chaos in Hong Kong to contain the overall development of China.” People’s Daily similarly blamed “extremists” for recent violent acts – citing in particular the damage caused to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building by protesters – in a commentary entitled “opposing violence together, and cherishing the rule of law”. People’s Daily also warned that Hong Kong’s economy would be hurt “if Hong Kong society cannot firmly say ‘no’ to violence” and reiterated the central government’s support for Lam’s administration and the Hong Kong police. While the Xinhua commentary mentioned the influence of “external forces” for the violence in Hong Kong, the People’s Daily piece did not. Beijing has sharply criticised foreign governments that have spoken in support of protesters. On Thursday the European Union passed a resolution that denounced police violence in Hong Kong and condemned “the constant and increasing interference by China in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.” China has demanded that other foreign governments, including the US and Germany, stay out of the city’s affairs after they issued statements of concern about the deteriorating room for political expression and freedom of speech in Hong Kong. On July 1, a number of protesters stormed the Legislative Council building following a peaceful march by hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers demanding the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. Hong Kong hospital authorities said dozens of people sustained injuries, and police said several officers were injured. There was further violence in a shopping centre last Sunday following a large rally in the New Territories.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019501/china-state-media-takes-aim-violent-extremists-hong-kong

They left before police arrived. The Civil Human Rights Front, the organiser of the march earlier in the day, said 430,000 people attended while police put the figure at 138,000 at its peak.  Crowds then advanced beyond the original police-mandated end point at Wan Chai to Queensway and Central, where they began occupying main thoroughfares of Connaught Road Central and Connaught Road West, blocking vehicles from getting through and putting up wooden barricades.

Central Hong Kong becomes battleground as riot police clash with protesters after third major march against extradition bill and siege of Beijing’s liaison office,"‘We have nothing to lose now, I am not afraid’, protester shouts as late-night clashes erupt between riot police and masked, helmeted youths in black; Government condemns protesters for changing the approved march route and vandalising China’s national emblem at liaison office","3:39pm, 21 Jul, 2019","“Since March 31, time and time again Hongkongers have pounded the streets. Not just with rallies and protests. Now we see Lennon Walls blossoming across the city. Our five demands are crystal clear,” Sham said.","The heart of Hong Kong’s business district was turned into a war zone on Sunday night as riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of protesters to chase them off the streets, after a day of defiance that saw them lay siege to Beijing’s liaison office for the first time in the social unrest over the now-suspended extradition bill. After another massive anti-government march from Causeway Bay to Wan Chai in the afternoon broke up into rolling waves of protests that spread to Admiralty, Central and Sheung Wan, the main road outside the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal became the smoke-filled battleground for late-night clashes between heavily geared riot police and masked and helmeted youths in black. Nearly two hours after police warned they would move in to clear the roads, fully equipped officers from the elite Special Tactical Squad let loose with tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters fought back or counter-attacked with bottles, bricks, poles, and umbrellas. “We have nothing to lose now, I am not afraid,” one of them shouted, while fires lit by protesters burned at the barricades they set up. The government issued a late-night statement to strongly condemn protesters for deviating from their mandated march route and challenging Beijing’s sovereignty by besieging the liaison office, where they vandalised the national emblem. The government vowed to investigate the attack, and the liaison office followed up with a statement saying while it respected those who expressed their views peacefully, marches had repeatedly ended in unlawful demonstrations, with protesters charging police cordons, laying siege to police headquarters and occupying roads. The liaison office statement said: “The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government strongly condemns the protesters who blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming the [liaison] building as well as defacing the national emblem. The HKSAR Government will deal with these acts in a serious manner in accordance with the law.” It also recapped how, a day earlier, authorities seized what was billed as the largest amount of the deadliest explosives ever uncovered in the city, along with pro-independence materials, from a home-made laboratory in a Tsuen Wan industrial building. “The [local government] is concerned that a small number of radicals incited the masses in an organised manner, challenged the rule of law, and even stormed the [liaison] office in Hong Kong,” the statement said. “Such acts threaten the law and order in the SAR and ‘one country, two systems’. It is totally unacceptable to society.” That was after masked protesters threw eggs at the front of the liaison office building in Sai Ying Pun, the symbol of Beijing’s presence in the city, spray-painted obscenities on the walls, blackened security cameras and shone laser light beams at staff trapped inside, before they retreated when they were warned that the riot squad would move in to clear the area. In a separate outbreak of late-night violence, witnesses said scores of men in white shirts stormed into Yuen Long MTR station and attacked passengers with rods. Multiple injuries were reported as people on the concourse were also indiscriminately attacked, including opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting. Reporters at the scene were attacked as well. At around 11pm, the MTR announced that trains running on the West Rail Line would not stop at the station. Police arrived at the scene half an hour later. Hundreds of thousands joined the peaceful main march from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Southorn Playground in Wan Chai, but many splintered off in different directions at around 5.30pm, going well beyond the mandated end point. The Civil Human Rights Front, the organiser of the march, said 430,000 people attended. Police put the figure at 138,000 at its peak. Large groups advanced to Central, heading for the Court of Final Appeal, occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty, bringing traffic to a chaotic halt, and later blocking major arteries Connaught Road Central and Connaught Road West. They also took over Des Voeux Road Central and Pedder Street, among others, many of them taking the protest all the way down Connaught Road Central to the terminal. Earlier, brawls broke out between protesters and drivers, one of whom was beaten up when he tried to take them on, arguing they had no right to block his vehicle. A group of protesters assaulted him with fists, feet and umbrellas, while others attacked his van, smashing its windows. “You can play and do whatever you want, but don’t do this to me,” he said, pleading that his vehicle was his livelihood, after some protesters pulled him away from the angry crowd. Hundreds laid siege to police headquarters in Wan Chai again, this time with the building protected by massive water barricades which protesters turned into another Lennon Wall of Post-it notes criticising law enforcers. They also hurled abuse at officers monitoring them from inside and flashed laser lights at them. Protesters also attacked the Central Police Station with bricks and spray-painted obscenities on the walls. The violence came after a third massive march against the extradition bill and the city’s embattled government, amid tightened security measures by police over fears of escalating violence. The original destination of the march was the Court of Final Appeal in Central. Organiser Civil Human Rights Front had lost its appeal a day earlier against police, who wanted to shorten the route for safety reasons. Leading the procession were Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, lawmakers Helena Wong Pik-wan, Gary Fan Kwok-wai, singer Denise Ho, and media mogul Jimmy Lai Chee-ying. The front held two massive peaceful marches on June 9 and 16, drawing an estimated 1 million and 2 million people respectively. The theme of Sunday’s march centred on demands made by protesters, among which is the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry to look into complaints about police brutality. Over the past weeks, protesters and police have clashed in running battles after marches, resulting in casualties and arrests. Sham also slammed police’s crowd control measures as “ridiculous”. “There is no clear guidance from police on how to leave Wan Chai after the march, except to say we should leave from the south side of Wan Chai. But there are big crowds in the same area heading to the book fair, as well as people everywhere in Causeway Bay and Admiralty. “If there are any disturbances or accidents today, the responsibility lies squarely with police,” Sham said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019483/tens-thousands-hong-kong-kick-third-major-protest-march
"Beset by fears for Hong Kong’s future as extradition bill protests continue to rage, many in the city are thinking of leaving","Two migration consultancy firms say they have seen jump in numbers making inquiries since June, with many people citing unrest as reason; Australia and Canada are most sought-after destinations for Hongkongers, with Taiwan also gaining in popularity","10:15am, 21 Jul, 2019","“Since March 31, time and time again Hongkongers have pounded the streets. Not just with rallies and protests. Now we see Lennon Walls blossoming across the city. Our five demands are crystal clear,” Sham said.","Mr Wong’s anxiety grew every time he watched videos or news footage of police firing tear gas and wrestling with protesters in Hong Kong, and has prompted him to seriously consider a way out for his family – emigration. The 46-year-old education professional witnessed the 1997 handover to China, the boom and bust in the city, and what he said was an increasing penetration of mainland Chinese culture and waning freedom in Hong Kong. For Wong, who did not want to give his first name, the extradition bill protests finally ended his desire to stay in the place where he was born, grew up and started a family. “The current political climate is not peaceful, and the Hong Kong I know is very different from what it was before the handover,” he said. “Emigration is a serious decision, and one I have to think about for my children’s future as well.” Wong is among a growing number of Hong Kong people considering leaving the city for good, a decision sparked by the ongoing political unrest. One migration consulting agency told the Post last week that the number of inquiries Hong Kong people made in relation to emigration had jumped 50 per cent since June, compared with previous months, while another had seen a tenfold increase in inquiries. “It is a phenomenon. I got several hundred inquiries the day after the June 12 protest, and since then, my five sales colleagues have been answering inquiries from 9am to 11pm every day,” said Andrew Lo, founder of immigration consultancy firm, Anlex. “From our conversations, they show people do not trust the government, have a strong fear of continuing to live in the city, and have lost hope for the future of Hong Kong. It’s quite sad.” Paul Bernadou, who set up the agency in Hong Kong that bears his name in 1993, said the number of inquiries had jumped 50 per cent since June, with many people citing the current political climate as a reason to relocate. Since June, the city has been fraught with tension, with several massive protest marches, the two largest of which organisers claimed drew 1 million and 2 million people onto the streets. On several occasions, protesters and the police have fought battles after the marches ended. There is also no end in sight, with protesters, mainly younger people, organising further marches in local communities running into August. Their aim is to push Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to meet their demands, which include the withdrawal of the now-suspended bill, and retracting the reference of riot to the June 12 protest. Although she suspended the bill on June 15, and subsequently called it “dead,” Lam has refused to withdraw it completely. The bill would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal, including mainland China. Wong, like other protesters who joined the marches, was opposed to the bill because he said the two legal systems were not compatible. What bothered him was the way the government pushed the bill forward, with only 20 days of public consultation, significantly less than the 90-day consultation on a bill to improve animal rights. Lam has admitted the way her administration handled the legislation was wrong and apologised to the people. “Part of the disappointment is the hard push of the pro-Beijing policy,” Wong said. “We have more and more mainland elements seeping into Hong Kong since the handover: more use of simplified characters, more Mandarin speakers, more mainland Chinese students, even signboards on top of buildings along Victoria Harbour are mainland brands. “I am not tolerant enough of these things.” According to Bernadou, Canada and Australia are the countries his clients are most interested in. Both are relatively safe, and have a lower cost of living, lower property prices, more good schools and universities, and large immigrant populations from Hong Kong. “There is a lot of discomfort with the political issue,” Bernadou said. “Hong Kong people take a long-term view for the future of their children, and even grandchildren.” In Wong’s case, he wants his children, aged 6 and 9, to grow up and be educated in a more stable environment, such as Canada. Lo, of Anlex, said that among those who asked about migration products, there was a woman in her 70s who was desperate to relocate abroad with her grandchildren, but who had difficulty fulfilling certain requirements, such as financial resources. “People should pause and think thoroughly before making a decision, and beware of unscrupulous agencies,” he said. According to the Canadian consulate general in Hong Kong, the number of Hongkongers granted permanent resident visas for the country jumped 12.13 per cent to 1,525 last year, while the number of applications also rose 7.4 per cent to 1,677 from the previous year. Taiwan emerged as a popular destination as well, with the number of people from Hong Kong and Macau emigrating there 10.6 per cent higher than 2017, at 1,267 last year, according to the island’s Immigration Department. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which is in charge of dealings with China, last week for the first time in years tried to entice new Hong Kong graduates on social media to migrate to the self-ruled island. Still, there are some younger people who do not consider emigration an option. Florence Lam, a 21-year-old nursing student and a regular at protests, is one of them. “I used to think I could move out of Hong Kong because the ‘one country, two systems’ policy will expire in 2047. By that time, I will be in middle age,” she said. “But the anti-bill movement woke me up, and I am very determined to stay here to protect my home city.” She was worried about her future because she said she would be competing with many mainland Chinese graduates in the city for jobs, and did not think she could afford to buy her own flat, based on the existing prices. Putting his thoughts about emigration into action is a quandary for Wong, who expects to leave behind his Hong Kong roots and many other things, start from scratch in a foreign country, a process that will be emotionally difficult for his family.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019457/beset-fears-hong-kongs-future-extradition-bill-protests
Extradition bill protests: why have Hong Kong’s business elite and tycoons abandoned Carrie Lam?,"Absence of support from sector is in stark contrast to 2014’s Occupy movement, with chief executive now isolated and fighting for political life; Other leading voices in society relatively muted this time are university leaders and the pro-establishment camp","7:00am, 21 Jul, 2019","It was a dry autumn afternoon in mid-October 2014 and the Occupy protesters’ sit-in on the major thoroughfares of Hong Kong was entering its third week.; Observers said business and other sectors were unwilling to provoke the current protest movement by openly siding with the government, for fear of being targeted for attack. After bloody clashes broke out last Sunday at Sha Tin’s New Town Plaza, the mall’s owner Sun Hung Kai was besieged by protesters who accused management of calling police even though they were not disrupting the peace.","The demonstrators were tidying up their supplies and makeshift tents when word rippled through the crowd of advice coming from an unlikely quarter. Li Ka-shing, the city’s richest man, had a message for protesters. Li, known for his reticence, issued a statement urging them to give up the streets. The students were demonstrating against Beijing’s proposal for the pre-vetting of candidates for Hong Kong’s highest office. “My young friends … You have successfully conveyed your message,” Li said. “I urge all of you not to let today’s fervour turn into tomorrow’s regret. I sincerely call on you to return to the side of your families.” The advice from Li, the embodiment of the rags-to-riches Hong Kong dream, carried weight. It was not certain how much his words influenced protesters, but Li’s intervention certainly bolstered the government, which was under attack for its use of tear gas on demonstrators. The contrast with the current situation could not be starker. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, fighting for her political life, appears to be all but isolated. Not a single tycoon or senior business leader has come out in public to offer words of support or comfort, in the midst of mass protests against her and the unpopular extradition bill since June, and even after violent clashes between protesters and police. Her predecessor Leung Chun-ying was deeply unpopular but, during his moment of crisis, he did not appear to be alone. Throughout the 79 days of the Occupy protest, many other business leaders apart from Li gave the establishment their vote of confidence, strengthening the government’s resolve. So why have the government’s traditional allies in business been conspicuously absent from Lam’s side? And why have more neutral parties also been subdued compared with at the height of Occupy? Fair-weather business friends? The business elites who have a hand in the political power balance in the city made up a quarter of the 1,200-member Election Committee that selected Lam as chief executive in a small circle election in March 2017. Observers pointed to several differences between Occupy and the current crisis that could explain the reluctance of the administration’s allies to identify themselves openly. Firstly, unlike the election framework that triggered Occupy, the extradition bill was conceived by Lam. Even if it was readily endorsed by Beijing, it was not a top-level directive from the central government. Hence, during Occupy and well before Li spoke, tycoons such as Henderson Land Development chairman Lee Shau-kee and Wharf Holdings chairman Peter Woo Kwong-ching, were quick to make statements. Beijing had expected no less from them, said observers, and indeed wanted more, if a curious report from Xinhua later that month was any indication. Two weeks after Li spoke, Xinhua published an English-language news report on October 25, listing the names of four Hong Kong tycoons, including Li, Lee and Woo and Robert Kuok Hock-nien, who, it said, were “reluctant to take sides” over Occupy. The report was mysteriously retracted seven hours later. No explanation was given, but it did its job in nudging the collective conscience of the rich and powerful of the city, reminding them what was expected from them. One after another, other billionaires in the city spoke up, stressing the need for stability for Hong Kong’s prosperity to continue. Secondly, the reluctance of the business elite this time had to do with their own stance on the bill: they saw their ilk as being potential targets of the legislation. Hence, apart from the chambers, local businessmen were also vocal in expressing their concerns. They included the likes of former No 2 city official Henry Tang Ying-yen, and the incoming chairman of the Trade Development Council Peter Lam Kin-ngok. Tang, now a standing committee member of China’s top advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the business sector’s worries over the bill were understandable. Newspaper tycoon Charles Ho Tsu-kwok, a CPPCC member, also urged government officials to think carefully. “In the past we have said that as we did business on the mainland, we could feel relaxed and comfortable when we returned to Hong Kong. I hope they can still feel the same in the future,” Ho said. Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok said: “Occupy was about Beijing, and the tycoons had to speak up … but the bill wasn’t. Lam also angered a lot of business leaders, and underestimated opposition in various sectors.” Polytechnic University political analyst Dr Chung Kim-wah said the tycoons’ current silence was to register their disapproval of the government’s arrogance.  Other friendly voices were missing Aside from the tycoons, there were other voices of reason during Occupy calling for calm and dialogue. During the early days of the movement, university chiefs, retired judges, as well as religious leaders weighed in. One of the most iconic images then was of two university heads, University of Hong Kong vice chancellor Peter Mathieson, and Chinese University vice chancellor Professor Joseph Sung Jao-yiu, their clothes drenched in sweat, talking to the crowd in front of the Chief Executive’s Office. They pleaded for students to avoid conflict and not destroy the movement’s good name. This time around, university chiefs took their time speaking up. After violent clashes on June 12, a statement was issued by 10 tertiary institution heads, urging all sides to be rational and calm. But their calls only became stronger after protesters stormed and vandalised the legislature on July 1. Most urged the government to hold talks with young people to find out the roots of their discontent. For example, in an email to students, staff and alumni last week, University of Science and Technology president Wei Shyy said that while violence should be condemned, he believed it was necessary to discuss the causes. Ma also said the current university heads were more cautious partly because the movement was without leading figures to engage with. “The student unions’ leaders were very involved in 2014, but this time the movement has been leaderless, and students were not the only focus,” he said. Fear and echo chamber City University political scientist Cheung Chor-yung said: “The business sector just wants society to stabilise. They will not help the government … They know that if they please one side, the other side becomes their enemy.” However, even without the business sector behind her, Lam could conceivably have turned to her pro-establishment allies. But again, the relationship had soured as momentum against the bill grew. The camp also fear if they are too closely associated with Lam, they could be punished in the district council elections in November and Legislative Council polls next year. Cheung said the camp had already lost points by failing to recognise the depth of ground sentiment against the bill. “They were too used to supporting proposals,” the political scientist said. And the chief executive wrongly assumed they would continue to serve as her echo chamber. “Lam was too arrogant to think that … the pro-Beijing parties would just cooperate with her,” Ma said. At some point, the pro-establishment camp’s relationship with the administration must be reviewed, said analysts. On Saturday, after more than a month of mass protests across the city, 72 convenors of the pro-establishment bloc finally held a rally, but organisers, while condemning the violence and expressing support for police, steered clear of fully throwing their weight behind Lam, only asking people to “give her more time”. Similarly, the current crisis may lead to a reappraisal of the position of the tycoons with the political establishment. Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of semi-official think tank The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said: “Beijing knows while the business sector supports the central government, it is opportunistic. After this saga, Beijing might not be that willing to take care of the big tycoons’ interests. Small and medium enterprises and young people also need Beijing’s attention.” Cheung said Lam, as a career civil servant, had not forged strong ties – and therefore social capital – with the tycoons. “The business elites only supported Lam during the election because Beijing endorsed her,” he said. Where are they now, Lam may be asking, while Beijing is watching.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019441/extradition-bill-protests-why-have-hong-kongs-business
Hong Kong protest organisers lose appeal over shortened route for latest march as police express fears for public safety,Independent appeal board backs move to end latest march at Southorn Playground in Wan Chai; Civil Human Rights Front had originally wanted protest to go from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Court of Final Appeal in Central,"9:38pm, 20 Jul, 2019","The organisers of Sunday’s extradition bill march have lost their appeal against the police’s decision to shorten the protest route, after the force expressed concerns over public safety amid the escalating violence of recent demonstrations.; The foiling of the city’s largest-ever bomb plot on the eve of march had deepened their concerns, Tse added, saying the change of the route was not a suppression and was needed to minimise the risks to public safety.; The arrangements, which have included the mobilising of nearly 4,000 police officers, were to “prepare for the worst”, said government sources. They stressed that the force’s management considered the safety of frontline officers to be a top priority as they looked to avoid a repeat of the bloody clashes with protesters last week, when 13 policemen were among the 28 casualties.","On Saturday, an independent appeal board ruled against the Civil Human Rights Front’s bid to overturn the move to end the route at Southorn Playground in Wan Chai. Organisers had initially wanted to march from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to the Court of Final Appeal in Central. The shorter route, which still begins at the park, prevents protesters from passing Police Headquarters in Wan Chai and the government head office and legislature in Admiralty. Both complexes have previously been besieged or damaged by protesters. But the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions upheld the group’s request to finish the march, which begins at 3pm, at 23.59pm, dismissing the force’s suggestion it end by 9pm. The board’s chairman, Dr Pang Kin-kee, said it had considered public order and the protection of others’ rights and freedoms before reaching a unanimous decision. Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, the Front’s convenor, complained after the ruling that it would be hard to disperse marchers in Wan Chai, given the annual book fair is being held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in the same district. He said they would ask protesters to leave as requested, but it was up to police to point out the exit routes. “If the crowd management is out of control during the march on Sunday, police and the appeal board should bear all responsibilities,” he said. He added a group of no more than 30 people planned to carry a banner to their intended end point in Central. But during the hearing, Jim Ng Lok-chun, senior superintendent for operations on Hong Kong Island region, said changing the end point to Wan Chai was necessary. He cited the fact that government buildings and police headquarters had been attacked in the protests in the past month, and noted the escalating level of violence in recent demonstrators. “We are not afraid of marchers entering [the risky spots],” he said. “We are afraid some radical people might be already at those sites, and the peaceful protesters could enter there.” Chief superintendent John Tse Chun-chung, from Police Public Relations Bureau, said officers noticed internet users had advocated the use of weapons during the rally, and to march from the approved routes. “Speaking from our experience from the last few weeks, protesters had gone from shouting slogans to blocking roads, and some even damaged public properties and shops. They attacked citizens and officers,” he said at a press conference after the decision was announced. “Protesters had lowered the threshold [of a peaceful protest] and are apparently poles apart from their original urge to pursuit justice. As a consequence, we are concerned about the way the possession will be conducted on Sunday.” The force also said it did not see the need to suspend the book fair, and would help protesters leave the district. Authorities have increased security around government and police headquarters, which were locked down and barricaded by two-metre-high water barriers to head off trouble ahead of Sunday’s protest, which organisers are expecting 50,000 people to attend. Tse said the water-filled barriers were intended to act as a buffer between police and protesters to minimise clashes. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Jockey Club has decided to temporarily close four off-course betting branches in Wan Chai and Central on Sunday as a result of the planned protest.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019451/hong-kong-protest-organisers-lose-appeal-over
Hong Kong pro-police rally attracts hundreds of thousands calling for force to be respected,"Organisers put attendance at 316,000 while police say there were 103,000 at rally in Tamar Park; Theme of rally was ‘Safeguard Hong Kong’, with attendees calling for rifts in society to be healed but many point finger at extradition bill protesters","9:33pm, 20 Jul, 2019","The rally organisers estimated 316,000 people attended, while police said there were 103,000 participants at its peak. A similar event was held on June 30, when organisers said 165,000 people joined, and police put the figure at 53,000.","Hundreds of thousands of government supporters gathered beside the administration’s headquarters to show solidarity and support for police on Saturday, a day before yet another massive march by extradition bill protesters. Co-organised by 70 pro-Beijing figures and themed “Safeguard Hong Kong”, the rally at Tamar Park on Saturday afternoon, was attended by local residents, members of ethnic minorities, mainland immigrants and professionals working in the city, as well as visitors from across the border. While their views differed on how the government had handled the political crisis and what it should do now, they were united in supporting police and condemning the violence seen in some of the protests, with some saying they did not want to see the rifts in Hong Kong widen further. The now-suspended extradition bill has triggered a series of mass protests since early June, with some resulting in bloody clashes between police and protesters, who have been calling for a withdrawal of the draft law and the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the saga. The rally was held as more than 60 relatives of police officers signed an open letter urging Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to stop using policemen as “human shields” between the government and the public, and to set up a judge-led inquiry committee. “We are furious that frontline police officers have to stand to the forefront in the face-off with protesters in demonstrations arising from political controversies … Frontline police officers are forced to bear the consequences of the government’s maladministration,” the relatives wrote. Kicking off the rally in the rain at 5pm, actor Nat Chan Pak-cheung and singer Maria Cordero led the crowd in chanting the slogan “Safeguard the rule of law. Oppose violence”. The guests who spoke on stage included three citizens from ethnic minority groups, who appealed to the different parties to have dialogue to find a solution. “I am not pointing fingers at anyone, as there’s no single party to be blamed,” one of them, who gave his name simply as Mohan, said. “Hong Kong is our home. Let’s not destroy it but make it a better place.” Elsie Leung Oi-see, former secretary for justice, told the crowd: “Some people have rule of law on their lips but they are actually destroying Hong Kong … we should not tolerate any acts breaking the law.” The 70 rally co-conveners included Margaret Leung Ko May-yee, managing director of Chong Hing Bank, and Kenneth Fok Kai-kong, vice-president of the Fok Ying Tung group, and former police commissioner Tang King-shing. Tang called on the crowd to support the force, saying officers had worked hard to make the city a safe place. His view was echoed by 30-year-old recent immigrant Liang Long. “If there is no respect for the police in Hong Kong, there will be no Hong Kong in the future,” he said, adding he was against the violence used in the protests, including the storming of the Legislative Council on July 1. But he said opposition to the bill was caused by the government’s failure to properly promote the draft law. A middle-aged businessman from Fujian, surnamed Wu, who travelled to Hong Kong to support the police, said: “I hope Hong Kong will continue to be peaceful and safe.” Local housewife Peggy Wai, 33, said: “I want to help Hong Kong. I am against violence and we don’t want to see the social rift.” While Wai and some participants were open to the idea of setting up an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the clashes, factory worker Chu Choi-pui, 55, disagreed. “They are rioters,” he said, referring to protesters involved in violent clashes with police. Some mainland professionals working in Hong Kong who joined the rally said they were worried the protests would affect the city’s economic development. A local resident, surnamed So, agreed, breaking down in tears as he said: “The young protesters are ruining Hong Kong and our economy.” The rally ended at 7.15pm with all the conveners reading out a joint statement on stage: “We don’t want violence. We don’t want a split. We want rule of law, peace, stability and unity!”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019450/government-supporters-turn-out-hundreds-thousands-hong-kong
Police looking for more than 700 ‘core’ extradition bill protesters involved in recent clashes in Hong Kong,"Sources say most of those wanted are under the age of 25 and are divided into two groups – one radical and violent, the other providing logistical support; Police are using image recognition software to identify protesters, most of whom concealed their faces. Several are believed to have already fled the city","8:00pm, 20 Jul, 2019","Peaceful marches on consecutive Sundays, on June 9 and 16, were attended by an estimated 1 million and 2 million people respectively, while the police headquarters in Wan Chai was twice besieged by thousands of protesters, on June 21 and 26.","Hong Kong police are trying to track down more than 700 core extradition bill protesters believed to be behind recent violent confrontations, including the bloody clashes in a shopping centre last Sunday and the 11-hour trashing of the city’s legislature on July 1, the Post has learned. Force insiders said most of those wanted are under the age of 25 and include many students from high schools, postsecondary institutions and universities in the city. One source said several of the protesters had already fled Hong Kong. “They are local residents. Investigations show they left the city to study overseas,” he said. Earlier, activists in Taiwan had said more than 30 protesters, including some involved in the storming of the Legislative Council building, had fled to the self-ruled island. Among those who fled the city is Brian Leung Kai-ping, 25, who was the only protester to deliberately reveal his face in the main chamber of the Legislative Council building on July 1, as he urged others to stay after storming the building. The sources said the core figures had been taught how to use face masks, helmets, gloves and goggles to hide their identities, how to daub surveillance cameras with paint and to use hand signals for on-site communication, making it difficult for local police to trace them and gather evidence. As well as being used to protect protesters from pepper spray, umbrellas served to build barriers to prevent officers from filming them in the act, according to the source. “After attacking police cordon lines, those hard-core protesters normally retreat and use the umbrella-wall as a screen to change their clothes and then leave the scene to avoid being identified by police,” he said. He said officers had to collect security camera footage along the protesters’ escape routes and find images of the suspects when they had removed their masks. Although police have used image recognition software to track down suspects, the source said officers would still have to pore over footage with the naked eye to cross-check and ensure they do not miss crucial evidence. The Post was also told the core protesters have divided into two groups. One group comprised 200 to 300 hard core radical protesters. “They are called martyrs and are deployed on the front line. They provoke police on site and use force and violent acts to attack police cordon lines and fight with officers,” another source said. After the attack, they retreat and change their clothes and leave before others move in. There were more than 500 people in the other group. They are called “wo, lei, fei” in Cantonese, meaning “peaceful, reasonable and non-violent”. “They are not involved in fights or clashes. Their roles are to deliver resources such as helmets, saline solution, plastic wraps and goggles, as well as bricks and railings, to the front line, ” he said. Saying the recent confrontations were organised and premeditated, the source said he believed those behind them had scouted the sites and identified the location of security cameras and areas where they could hide provisions. Towards the end of recent marches, radical protesters usually turned violent, acting by unlawful means to provoke and confront police. “Normally these core protesters wearing face masks cut in line near the end of a public procession and mingle with the crowds,” the second source said. “Once they reach their designated location, [the martyrs] gear up before charging police cordon lines.” The Post was told that police were first tracking down “martyrs” while trying to identify those behind the core protesters. The sources said the “wo, lei, fei” group would be the next target and they would face arrest for aiding and abetting criminal activities. The sources said the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau and the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon West and New Territories South regional crime units have been tasked to investigate recent clashes. A series of mass protests against the bill – which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions Hong Kong did not have an existing agreement with, including the mainland – have rocked the city since June. After clashes with demonstrators blockading the Legislative Council in Admiralty on June 12 and following the storming of the same building on July 1, police fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Opponents of the bill, which Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor suspended on June 15, have now expanded the battlefield from Admiralty and Wan Chai to other districts of Hong Kong. An estimated 230,000 protesters marched through the bustling tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui to the cross-border high-speed railway station in West Kowloon on July 6, marking the first mass rally to cross Victoria Harbour. While the march was peaceful, many stayed behind after the procession ended and occupied the main streets of Mong Kok, confronting police late into the night. Last Sunday, a peaceful march in Sha Tin drew an estimated 115,000 people before a confrontation started and then descended into violence that left 28 people injured, including 13 police officers. Since June 12, when police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse violent protesters outside the government complex in Admiralty, more than 120 people have been arrested in connection with the extradition bill protests, as well as for releasing the personal information of officers online.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019445/police-looking-more-700-core-extradition-bill-protesters

The Hong Kong students did not stay for long and returned to the city after exploring the possibilities in Taiwan, according to the source. “It was a time when things had turned really chaotic, after Hong Kong police responded to peaceful demonstrations with rubber bullets and after the ‘Raincoat Man’ suicide,” the source said, referring to a 35-year-old man in a yellow raincoat who fell to his death in Admiralty after hanging a banner protesting the now-suspended bill. “I’m not sure what resources they needed, only one thing – whether Taiwan could provide asylum on political grounds if the situation worsened for them in Hong Kong.” The source was speaking after Taiwanese activists revealed this week that between a dozen and 60 protesters had arrived from Hong Kong since early July, or were planning to seek shelter in Taiwan. The South China Morning Post has learned that more than 30 Hongkongers fled to Taiwan on July 2. “It was arranged by a group of supporters,” said a second source, adding that they could not be identified for fear of retribution. Lam, who has expressed fears over the controversial extradition bill, said he had learned about a group coming to Taiwan to seek asylum. “I understand that they already arrived in Taiwan earlier this month and have been helped by NGOs and human right groups in Taiwan, but they have not contacted me since they arrived,” Lam said. But he said the likelihood of them being granted asylum was not clear. “Unlike my case, these people have not been prosecuted, which would make it difficult for them to claim they have been persecuted,” he said, adding that he had spoken about the case to friends in Canada who offered to help some of the Hongkongers to seek shelter there. He said Hong Kong people who wanted to move to Taiwan could apply to study or work there, and later apply for citizenship. Lam, the former manager of Causeway Bay Books, is in Taiwan on a tourist permit while he looks for work, and is also considering opening a bookstore. But an observer based in Taiwan warned that Taipei could face retaliation from Beijing if it grants asylum to the Hongkongers. “Taiwan needs to consider if the mainland will use this to apply greater pressure or carry out retaliation,” said Alexander Huang Chieh-cheng, an associate professor in diplomacy and international relations at Tamkang University.

Chan Tong-kai is wanted on the self-ruled island in connection with the death of his pregnant girlfriend, but cannot be transferred there because the two places lack an extradition agreement. Presently in jail in Hong Kong after being found guilty of money-laundering, Chan could be released as early as October, at which point he would be free to leave Hong Kong. Ann Chiang Lai-wan, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said she visited Chan in Pik Uk Correctional Institution last Friday, and had a 40-minute conversation with him. Her visit came as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the extradition bill was “dead”. Lam’s announcement came after weeks of protests involving Hongkongers opposed to an amendment that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives from Hong Kong to Taiwan, mainland China and Macau. The death of Poon Hiu-wing, who was killed during a holiday to Taiwan with Chan, prompted Lam to push through her extradition bill. The city’s leader argued the legal loophole that allowed Chan to remain in Hong Kong needed to be closed. Poon’s father reportedly wrote to Lam last month and urged the chief executive to consider alternative proposals, including a negotiation with Taiwan for a one-off transfer, so Chan could stand trial. Lam’s office would not discuss details of the correspondence between the city’s leader and the father. Chiang’s visit only became public on Saturday, after the lawmaker released a statement detailing her visit. However, she said because of privacy concerns she could not disclose Chan’s response to her appeal. She said she applied for the visit two weeks earlier, writing to the Hong Kong Correctional Services in her capacity as a lawmaker. On the same day as her visit, Chiang’s party met Lam and suggested the government should urge Chan to turn himself over to Taiwan authorities. Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah was asked on Saturday if this was the only solution left for the government. “The government has nothing to add right now,” she said. Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to draft their own bills to resolve the matter. Labour Party legislator Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung withdraw his bill, which would allow the city to transfer criminal suspects to Taiwan, but not mainland China or Macau, hours after his proposal sparked fierce debate online on Thursday.

Denying she was discriminating against him, legislator Ann Chiang Lai-wan wrote on the social media platform on Friday that Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, the openly gay convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, was “not ready yet”, if he considered remarks she had made earlier this month an attack. The front was the organiser of two massive marches in June against the now-suspended extradition bill, estimated to have drawn 1 million and 2 million participants respectively. On July 1, Chiang shared a video on her Facebook page, slamming Sham and saying he had “never mentioned his sexual orientation” in his role within the pro-democracy group. “Deliberately concealing that, for power, money or fame?” captions in the video, which showed Sham in drag at an event, stated. “Corrupting social morals, just disgusting.” Sharing the clip, Chiang also wrote in her post: “Important news, please spread around.” Her post had 1,000 shares during the time it was online. The move drew instant criticism from gay rights groups, which lodged complaints to Facebook and the city’s equality watchdog, the Equal Opportunities Commission. The post then went missing on July 8, and as of last week, the footage was unavailable even on other pages which had shared it. A Facebook spokesman confirmed on Monday that Chiang’s post had violated its community standards. “Our standards do not allow content that attacks someone based on their sexual orientation,” the spokesman said in a response to the Post. “In this case, we reviewed the content against our community standards and determined it was in violation. Therefore, this content was removed from our platform.” Chiang however remained defiant after Sham took the matter to the equality watchdog a week ago. Together with Raymond Chan Chi-chuen, an openly gay lawmaker, the pair submitted a petition with more than 2,000 signatures, urging the watchdog to condemn Chiang. On Friday, she said on Facebook: “If the line ‘important news, please spread around’ is an attack, that only proves that although you’ve come out, you’re not ready yet.” “Jimmy Sham, if you’ve already came out, then face it. Don’t easily complain someone’s attacking you, understood?” she said, adding that she had gay friends to whom she had sent blessings. An industry insider noted it was rare for Facebook to remove a politician’s post, as it typically steered clear of upsetting any party in Hong Kong’s political spectrum. “From our understanding it is quite rare for Facebook to remove posts in the Asia region,” said the social media marketer, who requested anonymity because of dealings with the company. Facebook’s guidelines state that it does not allow hate speech, defined as direct attacks on “protected characteristics” of people, which include sexual orientation. Before Chiang’s comments on Friday, Sham had said: “Facebook’s removal of Chiang’s post is only appropriate. “By saying [my sexual orientation] was important news, Chiang was effectively endorsing questionable views in the video. Shouldn’t we demand more from our honourable lawmakers?” Sham added the video was also factually wrong, as he had publicly identified himself as a member of gay rights group Rainbow Action. The row between Chiang and Sham came amid one of Hong Kong’s biggest political crisis over the extradition bill, which if passed, would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city does not have such an arrangement.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019426/hong-kong-lawmaker-ann-chiang-and-civil-human-rights-front

Controlled explosions were conducted on site at the Lung Shing Factory Building on Texaco Road on Saturday as the police bomb squad disposed of some of the extremely powerful and highly unstable explosives. Senior superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said investigators were looking into the background of a 27-year-old man who was arrested in connection with the case to determine if it was related to the mass protest planned for Sunday, which has already sparked concerns about potential chaos because of a dispute over the route and duration of the march. Two men, both aged 25, were also arrested on Saturday night in connection with the find, one in Tsuen Wan and the other in Sheung Shui. Superintendent Alick McWhirter of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit said: “I think, without a doubt, this is the largest seizure we have ever come across in Hong Kong.” Referring to triacetone triperoxide, also known as TATP, an explosive substance among the materials seized, he added: “It is well known, unstable and dangerous.” The drama began at 10:30pm on Friday night when officers, acting on intelligence received, raided the building and found 2kg of powerful explosives, 10 petrol bombs and acidic substances being manufactured in the home-made lab, along with knives and metal rods. McWhirter said his squad handled about 1kg of TATP on Saturday morning and were still working on another kilogram of the explosives – the detonation and disposal process was expected to take some time. He said TATP was highly unstable and powerful, with the potential to cause exceptional damage. “There are multiple problems because we are dealing with the explosive in different stages of its manufacture … from ice-cold conditions to room temperature,” McWhirter said. “The nature of this explosive means that … over a number of hours, its sensitivity can change, making it a constant challenge for my officers to adapt.” All explosives had been safely handled by 9pm on Saturday. TATP has been used in deadly terrorist attacks around the world, including in Israel and the London bombings of July 7, 2005, in which 52 people were killed and more than 700 injured. A small amount of TATP is powerful enough to blow a car to bits, and it can be treacherous for handlers as well because of its instability. Items seized at the site on Saturday included a T-shirt with the logo of the Hong Kong National Front, a pro-independence group, leaflets saying “no extradition to China”, and a pamphlet on the June 9 protest march that drew historic numbers out onto the streets. Police also seized several sets of portable loudspeakers, gas masks, goggles, hard hats and catapults, along with at least one can of kerosene. Disqualified lawmaker Sixtus Baggio Leung Chung-hang, the spokesman of the Hong Kong National Front, was unavailable for comment by publishing time. His group issued a statement through its Telegram messaging app channel, acknowledging that the man arrested was a member, but denying any knowledge of the explosives. The group said the industrial unit was used to store acoustic equipment and other promotional materials. Senior superintendent Li said the unit had been rented out for several months and the police would not rule out more arrests. He condemned those behind the explosives lab for being irresponsible and posing a danger to society. They could face jail terms of up to 20 years under the law. Firefighters were called in early on Saturday morning and people were evacuated from the factory building as police cordoned off the scene for bomb experts to carry out controlled detonations. Six fire engines and two ambulances were sent to the scene. The case raised tensions in the middle of a weekend of ongoing and planned protests against the government’s now-suspended extradition bill, even as police ramped up security measures over fears of continued violence. In December 2017, three alleged members of a pro-independence party in Hong Kong were jailed for up to 46 months for making or possessing materials, including TATP, that could be used to produce explosives at the former ATV film studios in Ho Chung, Sai Kung. The case was uncovered shortly before the city’s legislature was to vote on a controversial electoral reform bill in 2015. They were suspected to be from the National Independent Party, which sought to make smoke bombs to sabotage the vote, according to a recorded police interview with one of the defendants that was played in court.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019429/bomb-disposal-squad-called-after-explosive-substance

With no vision, the 27-year-old relies on the voice-over function of her smartphone, which automatically reads out text, to consume news. However, as visual elements, including videos and photographs, dominate today’s media, she finds it difficult to get information without audio description, a problem that impacts the city’s 174,800 visually impaired residents, of whom 7,800 are completely blind, like Lee.  “Much of the online information is in the forms of pictures and videos. For us visually impaired people, we can’t watch them,” she says. People with hearing impairments face similar challenges. According to the latest survey conducted by community organisation Hong Kong Deaf Empowerment, only 52 per cent of people with hearing difficulties surveyed said they were aware the extradition bill had been suspended. They said they lacked access to information as most press conferences and live streams do not come with subtitles or sign language interpretation. To fill this gap, four Hongkongers have set up an online platform to provide news with audio descriptions – an additional narration intended primarily for visually impaired consumers of visual media. On its Facebook page, “News with Audio Description Hong Kong”, they add a soundtrack to videos, describing what is happening. For photographs, a detailed text describing what visual elements are featured is provided, so the visually impaired can listen on their smartphones. “As audio describers, we use simple, accurate language to describe visual elements to help visually impaired people form imagination and make information accessible to all,” says Dorothy Ngan So-yan, who has 10 years’ experience in providing audio descriptions. Since it began operating in June, the platform has provided soundtracks and written texts for many news stories about the ongoing protests against the suspended legislation that would, if passed, have allowed the transfer of fugitives from Hong Kong to jurisdictions with which it lacks an extradition agreement. The bill sparked weeks of protests from critics who believed it would leave city residents at risk of unfair prosecution north of the border. Aside from politics, the platform also provides news from other areas, such as Hong Kong’s university entrance exam, the Diploma of Secondary Education, and news concerning the city's LGBT community. To better meet consumers’ needs, the team browses online platforms frequented by the visually impaired to learn about their interests and select news accordingly. They also provide audio descriptions for news requested directly by consumers. In writing descriptions, audio descriptors try their best to be accurate and faithful to the images they are narrating. “All descriptions should be faithful to the facts,” says Zoe Wong Sui-lam, an audio descriptor of the team. Ngan said audio description was somewhat similar to radio broadcasting, but the former provides more details, including colours and shapes, to make it easier for the visually impaired to picture it for themselves. In written text for a photograph posted earlier this month on a news story on same-sex marriage, apart from describing the rainbow flag – a symbol of the LGBT movement – in the picture, the audio descriptor added the six stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet, with each colour representing a different meaning. The platform has 13 audio descriptors, and more than 350 followers, most with visual impairment like Lee. To serve more people, they are recruiting volunteers. “Visually impaired people should have a platform to participate in society. I think it is meaningful to help provide them with more opportunities through this,” says volunteer Chan Wai-fong. The most challenging part is describing images or videos in a way that is understandable for the visually impaired. “Being visually sound, we are likely to neglect the details which the visually impaired need to understand the message,” says another volunteer, Lee Ting-yan. Ngan, meanwhile, believes the visually impaired have the right to be full and effective participants in society, and providing them the means to do that is the “obligation of a civilised society”.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019343/hear-all-about-it-volunteers-bringing-news-citys-visually
"For Hong Kong students in Taiwan, island’s freedom and democracy appeal","Young Hongkongers living in Taipei say there is a ‘sense of crisis’ over the extradition bill; More than 30 protesters have reportedly fled to the island, fearing they will be prosecuted, and another 30 are planning to do the same","11:00am, 20 Jul, 2019","Hongkongers studying in Taiwan who support the campaign against the city’s controversial extradition bill say moving to the self-ruled island permanently is an option – but it is not a decision they want to rush into.; Tsai has acknowledged that Hong Kong protesters have fled to Taiwan and said the government would consider any applications to seek shelter there “on humanitarian grounds”, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.","They say the now-suspended bill has created a “sense of crisis”, and they fear they could lose their freedoms if the Hong Kong government is forced to take tougher action against protesters. Gary Cheung, 25, who is studying filmmaking at the National Taiwan University of Arts in Taipei, said he could understand Hong Kong protesters wanting to flee to the island. “It wouldn’t surprise me if a group of Hong Kong people are seeking political asylum here, fearing they will be prosecuted or even jailed for their involvement in the protests over the extradition bill,” Cheung said. On Friday, Taiwanese media reported that more than 30 Hongkongers had arrived in Taiwan to seek shelter because they feared they would be prosecuted over their involvement in storming the city’s legislature during protests on July 1. The activists were receiving assistance from local NGOs and human rights groups and were staying in different locations on the island, and another 30 protesters still in Hong Kong were also planning to go to Taiwan, according to the reports. “The bill has yet to be retracted and could possibly be revived if the Hong Kong government is forced by the mainland to take tougher action,” Cheung said, despite a pledge by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor that the shelved bill was “dead”. “That uncertainty explains why a number of protesters have this sense of crisis over the possible repercussions of the mass protests.” Hong Kong has been rocked by protests and violent clashes since early June, with up to 2 million demonstrators taking to the streets to oppose the bill that would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including mainland China, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial. The government suspended the bill, but protesters have continued to call for its full withdrawal and an independent investigation into the use of force by police. Cheung was one of dozens of Hong Kong students in Taiwan who showed their support for the protesters outside the presidential office in Taipei last month, calling on the island’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, to help those seeking asylum. “I can’t imagine what it will be like if this bill is revived and passed,” he said, claiming that Beijing could easily use it to detain people for speaking out against it. “Taiwan is the place of choice for many Hong Kong people, given its free and democratic environment. And since the government has offered strong support for the anti-extradition bill campaign, I hope it can reach out to these people and lend them a helping hand,” he said. Cheung, a first-year student, said staying in Taiwan was also an option for him after he graduated. “But I still want to go back to Hong Kong after graduation, to do something for my fellow citizens and do all I can to maintain the freedom and democracy there,” said Cheung, who was one of more than 80 people arrested and charged with “obstructing public servants in the course of their duty” when the final Occupy Central pro-democracy protesters were cleared from Mong Kok in 2014. Another Hong Kong student in Taipei, Ho Wing-tung, 22, who set up Hong Kong Outlanders, a group supporting the anti-extradition protesters, said she was pessimistic about the city’s future. “Even if we succeed in blocking the bill, there will be a second, third and fourth draconian bill to replace it sooner or later,” said Ho, who is in the final year of a philosophy degree at Chinese Culture University. “Since the one country, two systems model has been applied in Hong Kong, the mainland authorities have gradually changed what they want to change to obstruct a free and democratic system in the city,” she said. “Where is the so-called autonomy the Chinese government promised?” Ho added that Taiwanese should not believe that the model would be good for them. “Many Hong Kong people aged between 20 and 30 believe that the city would be better off being free from mainland control,” she said. Ho said living permanently in Taiwan was an option for her, but she also expected Beijing would try to erode the city’s freedoms and she wanted to do something for Hong Kong by going back and voicing her opposition. Lin Fei-fan, 31, who was a leader of the Sunflower student movement in Taiwan in 2014 that blocked a sweeping trade deal with the mainland, said many civic groups and the Taiwanese government supported the campaign against the extradition bill in Hong Kong, and they were watching the situation closely. “Taiwan doesn’t have refugee legislation, but for those who need help from the government they can use the Act Governing Relations with Hong Kong and Macau,” Lin said. Under the act, assistance is to be provided to residents of the two cities if their safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons. Lin said the Hong Kong protesters should be able to stay in Taiwan if they met certain requirements. There are nearly 9,000 students from Hong Kong in Taiwan at present. They can apply for permanent residency after working in Taiwan for five years, and they must live there for 183 days of the year.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3019403/hong-kong-students-taiwan-islands-freedom-and-democracy-appeal
How Hong Kong’s Lennon Walls became showcases for art and design of extradition bill protests,"Walls have sprung up all over Hong Kong in past two weeks, having been first seen in city during Occupy protests in 2014; The Hong Kong iterations are based on an original one that was mounted in Prague after John Lennon’s assassination in 1980","10:00am, 20 Jul, 2019","A Hong Kong protest Lennon Wall has just appeared on the tourist trap steam clock in Vancouver’s Gastown. Quite smart because the clock ding-dongs every 15 minutes and tourists constantly take photos of it. pic.twitter.com/opgiyDNzYk; — Joanna Chiu 趙淇欣 (@joannachiu) July 13, 2019","Hong Kong has been rocked by waves of protests against the government’s extradition bill since June. But while opposition to the now-suspended bill has at times been fierce, the episode has also inspired many Hongkongers to express themselves in a quieter, more creative way. Since last week, displays of colourful sticky notes have sprouted up across the city, making international headlines. Known as Lennon Walls, the displays made up of anti-bill messages and other protest statements have transformed entire underpasses, pedestrian bridges and even shopfronts into multicoloured billboards. City Weekend takes a closer look at how the protest movement has become a major source of inspiration for the creation of art and memes. The origin of the Lennon Wall The colourful walls get their name indirectly from one of the most iconic figures in popular music, John Lennon, who was also an anti-war activist in his later life. The original Lennon Wall sprang up spontaneously in his honour in Prague following his assassination on December 8, 1980. Lennon’s pacifist anthems recorded during his solo career after the break-up of The Beatles, such as Give Peace a Chance and Imagine, became anthems for anti-war movements across the world. The latter, with the lyrics “imagine all the people, living life in peace”, was also sung during the 2014 Occupy protests in Hong Kong. After Lennon’s death, an unknown artist painted a picture of him and some lyrics on a wall located in a secluded square across from the French embassy in Prague. At the time, Western music and symbols were repressed, and sometimes banned, in the country, still known as Czechoslovakia and behind the iron curtain, and the image of Lennon was essentially a form of protest. The Czechoslovakian secret police, the StB, quickly painted it over, but the initial image of Lennon triggered an unstoppable deluge of anti-Communist graffiti. After the peaceful toppling of the Communist regime in November 1989 during the Velvet Revolution, the wall became a popular – and ever evolving – site for calls to activism worldwide and a vibrant landmark in the city. In November 2014, on the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, the wall was painted over in white by a group of student artists, leaving behind only the words “wall is over”. But the wall did not remain blank for long, with the graffiti and messages soon returning. In April this year, the Czech Republic branch of Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group, repainted the Lennon Wall with the words “klimatické nouze” which means climate emergency in Czech. How did the Lennon Wall become a site of protest art in Hong Kong? In Hong Kong, the Lennon Wall first appeared in 2014 on an outdoor staircase leading to the Hong Kong government headquarters. As police began to clear protesters who had been occupying Admiralty, an online version of the Lennon Wall appeared. Students in Causeway Bay also constructed a miniature Lennon Wall in December that year. After police used tear gas on protesters, crowds grew and began spreading and occupying other areas, including Causeway Bay, a hopping hub, and even Nathan Road in Mong Kok. Last month, the Lennon Wall in Admiralty quickly reappeared at the same location as in 2014 after one million people marched on June 9 to voice their anger over the bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions with which the city lacks an extradition agreement, including mainland China. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor suspended the bill on June 15. Among the posts were messages such as “Hong Kong, add oil”, “Carrie Lam step down” and “My dear, democracy is a good thing”, along with caricatures of the police, who had pepper-sprayed, tear-gassed and fired rubber bullets at protesters. As the protests continued, more and more of the colourful walls began to spring up across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and beyond, even as far as some of the outlying islands. Among the biggest are in Tai Po, Causeway Bay and Austin. Outside Hong Kong, Lennon Walls sprang up in Toronto, Canada, Tokyo, Berlin and London, just to name a few. There is even a Lennon Clock in Vancouver’s Gastown, where supporters have left notes on a steam-powered clock that rings every 15 minutes. The walls are also a place for people to gather and commiserate. A video shared on Twitter showed a group of people at the Lennon Wall in an underpass tunnel near Tai Po Market Station singing one of the unofficial anthems of the protests, Under a Vast Sky by the Canto-rock band Beyond. But the walls have also met with anger in some places, with pro-Beijing and pro-police citizens attempting to strip away the messages, which has led to altercations, with several people arrested. More than 200 police in riot gear also visited the Lennon Wall in Tai Po on July 10 to remove posters that disclosed the identities and personal details of some officers. How does one piece of art inspire the creation of others in the movement? The police’s actions in Tai Po provided yet more inspiration for activists – including the creation of numerous online memes. One was a parody of the poster for the new Lion King film – the Cantonese term for arresting people sounds similar to “lion” in English, and in Cantonese, tearing paper is a homonym for the Cantonese name for the lion. The memes have also appeared on Lennon Walls as Hongkongers turn to humour to vent their frustration. Another popular installation at the Lennon Walls are posters of Carrie Lam next to a hanging flip-flop, allowing passers-by to strike the chief executive’s likeness with the shoe. The practice derives from the tradition of “villain hitting”, where people can pay a woman to curse their enemies as they “hit” paper figures with an old shoe. The walls have also become a means of communication. Large QR codes invite people to “scan for the latest travel tips” but they actually provide links to a website explaining the anti-extradition protests written in simplified Chinese. The use of the script prevalent on the mainland suggests these are aimed at visitors from across the border. Due to censorship on the mainland, many Chinese are unaware of the events unfolding to the south. Additionally, protesters also turned the window of a Yoshinoya restaurant outlet into a Lennon Wall, after the pro-government boss of the Japanese chain’s local franchise pulled a Facebook post that made fun of police for removing notes on a Lennon Wall. Marvin Hung Ming-kei, CEO of Hong Kong-listed Hop Hing Group, which runs Yoshinoya restaurants across the border, told mainland media he was outraged at the post, which he was not informed of in advance. During a protest in Sha Tin on Sunday, a Yoshinoya outlet boarded up its windows and doors with plywood, and protesters used it to post messages and memes. Some messages read “rats inside” and “boycott”, while others drew a policeman as a Chikuya, a popular Japanese food called Si Zi Gau in Cantonese, the literal meaning of which is “lion dog”. The name also sounds similar to “a dog that tore paper” in Cantonese. The walls have also become a place to display protest art. Well-executed art and design has been a staple of Hong Kong protests since 2014, with London’s celebrated Victoria and Albert Museum featuring several pieces of art from the Occupy Central movement in a special exhibition called “Disobedient Objects”. This year, art featuring four walking legs against a black background offered a poignant reminder of the four people who took their own lives, citing their opposition to the extradition bill. “We will continue on for the four of you,” reads the text above the image. Other art includes caricatures of Carrie Lam and police, while others drew the famous Lion Rock with the words “Hong Kong add oil” written down its face. With more demonstrations planned, the protesters’ anger shows no sign of abating, but there is at least one thing Hong Kong can be sure of – there will be no shortage of inspiration for local artists and creators.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019352/colourful-irreverent-and-endlessly-creative-how-lennon
Taiwan struggling to deal with influx of Hong Kong protesters seeking refuge,"Anywhere between a dozen and 60 protesters have arrived on the island since July, but there is no clear legal road map for how to process their cases; President Tsai Ing-wen has said their cases will be handled ‘appropriately’ but it is not clear if the government will give them refuge","7:15am, 20 Jul, 2019","Although President Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday that Taiwan would “handle their cases in appropriate ways” and on “humanitarian grounds”, the government has yet to indicate if it would offer refuge to the protesters.","Taiwan is struggling to handle the sudden arrival of dozens of extradition bill protesters from Hong Kong who want to seek refuge on the self-ruled island. Although members of Taiwanese civil society have already offered safe houses for the new arrivals, their status remains unclear since the protesters have not yet been charged with criminal offences in Hong Kong and verifying their claims to have taken part in the mass protests will be tricky. Legal analysts also warned that the situation would be further complicated by Taiwan’s lack of clear and specific laws on handling asylum and refugee claims. According to Taiwanese activists who are assisting the new arrivals, between a dozen and 60 protesters have arrived from Hong Kong since early July, most of whom are currently staying in hostels with the aid of local civic bodies. Activists argue that Taiwan urgently needs to speed up its legislative process for handling refugees and asylum seekers as the island has seen an increasing number of applicants from places such as mainland China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East in recent years. However, they said the new arrivals from Hong Kong were a surprise and questioned whether the Taiwanese public would welcome them. “Would the Taiwan public accept their vandalising of the legislature in Hong Kong as an act of non-violence?” asked Bei Ling, a researcher from the National Chung Cheng University in Taipei. “Would they be seen as democracy activists who are fighting for political freedom?” “I think such a consensus may not even be shared among the politicians in Taiwan,” Bei said, pointing out that the protesters from Hong Kong – many of whom wore masks during the July 1 protests – could not be compared with the local activists who campaigned for greater democracy without concealing their identity during Taiwan’s Sunflower Movement in 2014. Bei said that the protesters’ case was also weakened because they would need to prove that they would face political persecution if they returned to Hong Kong, but they had not been officially charged and were able to leave the city legally. Under Taiwanese law, the government is obliged to offer the “necessary assistance … [to] Hong Kong or Macau residents whose safety and liberty face immediate threats for political reasons”. But Tseng Chien-yuan, chairman of the New School for Democracy and a consultant to the Taipei city government, said there were other options available for the Hong Kong protesters who want to stay in Taiwan. “The Hongkongers can stay in Taiwan by extending their tourist visas as a temporary solution or they can apply for longer-term options such as work or study visas before they can apply for residency,” he said. “They can extend their one-month tourist visas upon expiry on political grounds, although Taiwan doesn’t have a system to handle asylum applications,” he said. “One can apply for residency [in Taiwan] with an investment of no less than NT$6 million [US$193,000), get a job that pays no less than NT$50,000 a month or get a student visa by enrolling with a local university. They can then apply for residency if they work in Taiwan for five years after graduation and stay here for at least 183 days each year.” The island, which Beijing insists is part of China, is not a party to the United Nations’ Refugee Convention – which outlines the rights of those who are granted asylum and the responsibilities of nations granting asylum – and does not have its own legislation on refugees. Chiu E-ling, secretary general of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, called on the Taiwanese government to speed up legislation to process refugees and offer protection to asylum seekers because of the rising number of claims. Katherine Tseng Hui-yi, from the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore, said the fate of the protesters could become a political issue that may influence Taiwan’s presidential elections in January. “Tsai Ing-wen can claim credit from these cases,” she said. However, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing, ridiculed the independence-leaning president using a slang term for someone standing on shaky ground. “Save your false compassion [for Hong Kong people],” said Geng on Friday when asked about Tsai’s comments. “You are nothing but a clay idol crossing the river.” Separately, Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, a member of the city’s Executive Council, or cabinet, said the relationship between Hong Kong and Taiwan would suffer if Taipei offered refuge to the protesters and the island would be seen as a “haven” for lawbreakers. “It could affect our law enforcement agencies’ future communication and cooperation with Taiwan police. It will also send out a bad message that Taiwan is willing to grant asylum to criminals,” she said. The Hong Kong Security Bureau and police did not comment on the cases.

Security lockdown in city as Hong Kong government and police headquarters are barricaded with water barriers to ‘prepare for the worst’ with protesters,"Police also tell organiser Civil Human Rights Front to shorten its proposed march route, ending the event in Wan Chai rather than in Central; Organisers expect 50,000 people to join the march but police sources say the force anticipates a higher turnout","10:19pm, 19 Jul, 2019","The arrangements, which included the mobilising of nearly 4,000 police officers, were to “prepare for the worst”, said government sources. They stressed that the force’s management was placing as a top priority the safety of frontline officers to avoid a repeat of bloody clashes with protesters last week, when 13 policemen were among the 28 casualties.; Ahead of the weekend’s march, metal fences, bus stop poles and rubbish bins used by protesters to occupy thoroughfares in recent demonstrations against the now-suspended extradition bill are also being removed from roadsides in several areas on Hong Kong Island.","Authorities have begun imposing a security cordon in Hong Kong as government and police headquarters were locked up and barricaded by two-metre-high water barriers on Friday evening to head off trouble ahead of Sunday’s mass protest. Citing public security concerns, police also told march organiser the Civil Human Rights Front on Friday to shorten its proposed route from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to the Court of Final Appeal in Central and to end the event outside the Southorn Playground in Wan Chai. The front is appealing against the decision. While the organisers told police they expected 50,000 people to join the march, sources said the force anticipated a higher turnout. Peaceful marches on consecutive Sundays on June 9 and 16 were attended by an estimated 1 million and 2 million people respectively. Force insiders said the police headquarters in Wan Chai would be fenced off with two-metre-high water-filled barriers for the first time as they expected the complex and the government headquarters in Admiralty to be stormed by protesters after the march. The police building was besieged and defaced with eggs and graffiti by protesters who blocked exits and flashed laser beams at officers twice last month. Two government sources said that the administrative wing asked civil servants on Friday to lock all confidential documents and doors, and to remove the name plates of offices before they left work in the evening, with one adding that the lifts would also be locked on Sunday. The arrangements were made to “prepare for the worst”, one of them said. In a response, the administrative wing said security measures at government headquarters were subject to regular review and “appropriate adjustment will be arranged as necessary”. The Post learned that five regional response contingents, each consisting of about 600 officers, are among nearly 4,000 officers to be deployed on Sunday. The number would be higher than the 2,500 officers deployed in Sha Tin last Sunday. Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung pledged in a recent meeting with four police associations to make officers’ safety a priority in response to last Sunday’s running battles with protesters in the New Town Plaza shopping centre in Sha Tin. More than 100 elite officers from the Special Tactical Squad, known as the blue team, will be on standby. The squad comprises officers from the force’s counterterrorism division and airport security unit. Force insiders said police would maintain a minimum presence along the route of the march to avoid frontline officers being verbally abused by marchers. Officers from the force’s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau have been tasked to monitor online forums and chat rooms used by radical groups. “Investigation shows the police headquarters [in Wan Chai] and the government headquarters [in Admiralty] will be possible targets of protesters after the march,” one of the sources said. To enhance security around the government headquarters, water-filled barriers were set up around the complex earlier this week. The police headquarters will be fenced off with the barriers on Saturday. Apart from blocking invaders, another source said the giant barriers could prevent protesters from damaging security surveillance cameras and daubing the surrounding walls. “This helps to deploy fewer officers outside the buildings and also reduce the chance of conflict between police and protesters,” the source said. He continued that “the safety of officers is our key concern”. When asked whether the force would make a mass arrest of rowdy protesters and use a tougher approach to deal with possible unrest, the source said it would depend on the on-site situation. Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit said the police decision to shorten their march route was unreasonable, even though they were told it was because some internet users had threatened to engage in violent acts near the government headquarters that day. “How can we disperse so many people in Wan Chai?” he asked. Sham added that the front had said the march would be lawful, safe and peaceful. He previously explained that they had chosen the city’s top court as the finishing point to underline their hope that a judge-led inquiry would restore the city’s rule of law. Sham added on Friday that he was also upset not just with the shorter route but that police said only three westbound lanes on Hennessy Road would be opened for marchers, and that the rally must end at 9pm instead of midnight. In previous demonstrations, six lanes on Hennessy Road were opened for marchers, and the front was allowed to end the march as late as midnight.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019395/security-lockdown-city-hong-kong-government-and-police

The rankings for government performance and freedom of speech also dropped last year.; According to Chong Tai-leung, an associate professor of economics at Chinese University, rising housing and rental prices were decreasing the quality of life for Hongkongers.; The index for society, however, increased to an all-time high with a score of 29.06. The increase was because of improvements to the crime rate, public expenditures on education and university placements.; The Chinese University researchers warned that this year’s ratings could worsen because of the crisis triggered by the suspended extradition bill, which has led to a series of mass protests against the government.; He said there were many issues that divided society last year, including the disqualification of Legislative Council members and Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s controversial Lantau Island reclamation plan.","The quality of life for Hongkongers declined in 2018 and the effects of the extradition bill crisis could make it even worse this year, according to an annual index compiled by university researchers. The study, conducted in January with 1,002 respondents, found the overall quality of life index score for Hong Kong in 2018 was 105.96, a decrease of 0.63 points from 2017. The base score for the index is 100, which was the score for 2002 when the research was first compiled. The index consists of 23 indicators grouped into five sub-indices: health, society, culture and leisure, economy and environment. The economic index was at a record low in 2018 with a score of 11.89, a drop from 12.65 in 2017. The housing affordability index dropped 17.7 per cent in 2018, and the rental index fell 13.2 per cent. “In 2018, the housing prices rose by over 5 to 10 per cent, so I believe this trend will keep going,” Chong said. He pointed out that it can take a middle-class family around 17 years to afford a flat in Kowloon. The political situation in 2018 caused government performance to decrease by 7.4 per cent and freedom of speech to drop by 2.2 per cent. Professor Wong Hung, director of the Centre for Quality of Life and Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, said the city’s worsening political climate forced people to practise self-censorship – such as holding back their opinions from family and friends. Wong said the government had not been efficient or open enough when in terms of policymaking. “The effects of the current demonstrations will affect housing prices in the coming months because it has already affected the retail sector,” Chong said. “Overall the housing price impact may reduce in the coming months slightly, [although] reduction may not be high.” Wong agreed, saying “Division and conflict are quite high among friends, family and media. It is not really quite free to express ideas in Hong Kong and we can expect it to worsen this year.” Wong said the government should change its style of governance if it wanted to improve Hong Kong’s quality of life. “They need more coordinated efforts between different departments to be more responsible and efficient” he said. “There should be more consultations and exchanges with citizens to really listen and respond to their needs.”",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019388/hong-kongs-quality-life-declined-2018-annual-index-shows

The condition was imposed as Wong Kin-hoi, 46, was granted HK$5,000 (US$640) cash bail on his first appearance at Kwun Tong Court on Friday. The Ngau Tau Kok resident has been charged with two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence punishable by three years’ imprisonment. Prosecutors alleged that he assaulted Lee Chun-kwong and Mak Sai-kit on July 11 outside the construction site of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre in Ngau Tau Kok, where a Lennon Wall had appeared. Such walls have sprung up across the city, with people leaving messages on Post-it notes related to the anti-extradition protests, a movement some pro-Beijing critics have accused of being backed by foreign powers.

Hong Kong extradition bill protests begin to bite as city records drop in short-haul travellers,"Hong Kong Tourism Board reports 3.3 per cent decline in short-haul arrivals at start of July, and slowest weekly growth since middle of June; But overall outlook remains positive, with city expected to welcome record 65.1 million travellers over course of year","4:12pm, 19 Jul, 2019","He said major events such as the e-sports festival, cyclothon, and Wine & Dine Festival, were scheduled for the coming months.","Short-haul visitor numbers to Hong Kong dropped sharply this month as the city began to feel the impact of the ongoing protests against the extradition bill. Latest figures showed visits by tourists from Asia, excluding those from mainland China, dropped 3.3 per cent between July 1 and July 5, year on year. While the Hong Kong Tourism Board said tourists arrivals overall grew 4.2 per cent for the same period, that represented the lowest weekly growth since the middle of June. On Friday, Anthony Lau Chun-hon, the board’s outgoing chief executive, said June’s tourist arrivals, which jumped 8.5 per cent from the same period last year, still reflected the impact of the US-China trade war. “There were fewer visitors coming from the mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea since June, which might be because of fast information flow [on the protests],” he said. “The forward booking of air flights and hotels and other tours in Hong Kong will be challenging in the next couple of months.” In the first six months, the city’s total tourist arrivals soared 13.9 per cent to 34.87 million. The board estimated the full year’s total this year will be a fresh record of 65.1 million. Since June, Hong Kong has been rocked by a series of protests, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets to march against the now-suspended legislation. Most of the marches started in the prime shopping district of Causeway Bay and ended in the tourist and governmental district of Admiralty, with roads blocked and business disrupted. On July 1, when the city celebrated the 22nd anniversary of its return to China, thousands of protesters stormed the Legislative Council building in Admiralty, and vandalised its facade and key facilities. The incident, which made international headlines, left the legislature shut for at least four months. The bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be transferred from Hong Kong to jurisdictions the city does not have any extradition agreement with, including mainland China. The number of mainland visitors, who accounted for 79 per cent of the city’s total, surged 16.4 per cent to 27.55 million in the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year. Although mainland visitors kept coming to Hong Kong during the period, 62 per cent of them came on one-day trips and spent relatively less. More bad news is those mainland visitors who stayed overnight spent 18.5 per cent less in the first half of this year due to the combined effect of the depreciation of the yuan against the Hong Kong dollar, the impact of the trade war and changing spending patterns. “This is the sharpest drop in record,” Lau said. As a result, the overall tourists’ spending was down 13.6 per cent to HK$6,010 (US$769) per person per trip in the first half of the year. Hoteliers felt anxious about advance booking for the rest of summer as the protests showed no sign of abating, according to internal findings of 60 per cent of the 160-member Hong Kong Hotels Association, which the Post obtained. Some members of the industry body, who operate in districts at the heart of the protests, such as Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Admiralty, were affected in terms of bookings for events and food and beverage services. “The longer the political unrest drags on, the worse off the tourism industry will be,” a hospitality expert said. In the first five months of the year, Hong Kong hotels were on average 90 per cent full, or 1 percentage point higher than the same period last year, according to the board. This was despite the fact that the number of hotel rooms in the city grew 4 per cent during the period. The city’s average room rate climbed 0.6 per cent to HK$1,364 in the five-month period. Pang Yiu-kai, the board’s chairman, said it would continue marketing Hong Kong overseas to show the city was a safe place to visit. Lau said the trade war between the United States and China continued to hit business travel, with long haul visitors numbers down 4.1 per cent in June from the same month last year.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3019309/hong-kong-extradition-bill-protests-begin-bite
Heavyweight backing for independent inquiry into Hong Kong extradition bill clashes,Ex-government ministers and former allies of the city leader among 35 signatories of joint statement; Religious leaders call for full withdrawal of the legislation,"3:28pm, 19 Jul, 2019","More than 30 senior leaders from across Hong Kong civil society – including ex-government ministers and former allies of the city leader – have called on the administration to launch an independent inquiry into recent clashes between protesters and police sparked by the extradition bill.; They said an independent inquiry could establish the truth about the clashes between protesters and police since the first major confrontation in Admiralty on June 12.; There have been widespread calls for a judge-led commission of inquiry, with former chief justice Andrew Li Kwok-nang among the latest to support such a move, in a Post commentary.","Local Christian leaders joined the call in a separate appeal. In the joint message, Cardinal John Tong and Reverend Eric So Shing-yit, chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Council, also urged the bill’s withdrawal. In a statement issued on Friday morning, 35 signatories to the first statement said a commission of inquiry would be the best way to ease tensions and heal divisions in society in the wake of the debacle over city leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s extradition bill. “The chief executive should show her political and moral courage to resolve the ongoing conflicts in society,” the statement read. “Political problems have to be resolved by political means. The government should not put frontline police officers near flashpoints of political conflicts.” Leading microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung and former Chinese University vice chancellor Joseph Sung Jao-yiu were among the signatories. So were chairman of the Harbourfront Commission Vincent Ng Wing-shun, chief executive of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Shirley Yuen, former chairman of the Commission on Youth Philemon Choi Yuen-wan, and chairman of Hong Kong Television Network Ricky Wong Wai-kay. Ng nominated Lam for chief executive in 2017. Former deputy broadcasting director Tai Keen-man, who also signed the joint statement, was Lam’s election campaign spokesman. Eight former political appointees, including former labour and welfare minister Stephen Sui Wai-keung and former undersecretary for transport and housing Yau Shing-mu, also signed the statement, as well as former government economist Kwok Kwok-chuen. The first batch of signatories opened an online link for their joint statement around 4.30pm on Friday. By 10.30pm, more than 700 signatures have been collected, in addition to the first 35. Lam on July 9 rejected calls for a top-level investigation into clashes between police and protesters. She said the Independent Police Complaints Council would investigate and all parties could provide information. Protests in the city last month attracted up to 2 million demonstrators, who took to the streets to oppose a bill that would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city does not have a fugitive agreement, including mainland China. The government suspended the bill and indicated it would not return it to the legislature, but protesters continued to call for its full withdrawal. The group’s statement also called on protesters not to resort to violence, adding that senior police officers should avoid escalating conflict when devising strategies for handling protests. Meanwhile, nine city groups and nine professionals from business, education, social welfare, arts and IT sectors, issued a joint statement on Friday calling on the government to set up a commission of inquiry. The signatories included the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools, the Information Technology Federation, the Council of Social Service, United Muslim Association, the Hong Kong Art and Design Community, the Chartered Institute of Marketing, and Eric Cheung Tat-ming, the University of Hong Kong law scholar.

Tsai Ing-wen says ‘friends from Hong Kong’ will be considered for asylum on humanitarian grounds,"Taiwanese president makes first acknowledgement of reports that Hong Kong protesters are fleeing to the island; Act Governing Relations with Hong Kong and Macau allows Taiwan to assist where safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons, but it is not party to UN Refugee Convention","11:45am, 19 Jul, 2019","Tsai was speaking after media reports suggested that at least a dozen and as many as 60 protesters had arrived in Taiwan or were planning to seek shelter there, following protests and violent clashes in Hong Kong over the city’s extradition bill.; On Thursday, the European Parliament voted to adopt a resolution calling for the formal withdrawal of the bill. Beijing said the motion represented “ignorance and prejudice”.","Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has acknowledged for the first time claims that Hong Kong protesters are fleeing to the self-ruled island and said it would consider any applications to seek shelter there on humanitarian grounds. “I believe relevant departments are keeping abreast of the situation,” Tsai was quoted as saying by Taiwan’s Central News Agency in a media briefing in Saint Lucia on day two of her tour of the Caribbean. “These friends from Hong Kong will be treated in an appropriate way on humanitarian grounds.” Radio Free Asia reported on Thursday that about 10 Hong Kong protesters had arrived in Taiwan. Apple Daily said about 30 had arrived on the island and 30 more were planning to follow. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council played down the reports on Thursday. Without saying whether it was in contact with alleged protesters or how many were in Taiwan, the council said that if Taiwan received applications from Hong Kong residents for political asylum, government agencies would handle them according to the law, based on the principle of protecting human rights and regulations regarding Hong Kong and Macau affairs. It said it would provide necessary assistance to Hong Kong citizens whose safety and freedom were threatened by political factors. An unnamed Taiwan lawyer who helps Hong Kong residents arriving in Taiwan told Radio Free Asia the protesters had encountered technical difficulties in seeking to extend their stay. Protests and violent clashes have been ongoing in Hong Kong since early June. The Hong Kong government has said the extradition bill – which would allow the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions the city does not have an extradition deal with, including mainland China – is “dead”, but protesters have demanded its formal withdrawal and an independent investigation into the use of force by Hong Kong police. A pro-establishment “Safeguard Hong Kong” rally will be staged on Saturday to condemn violence and support police, a day before another massive march against the city’s embattled government. Taiwan’s Act Governing Relations with Hong Kong and Macau says necessary assistance shall be provided to Hong Kong or Macau residents whose safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons. The Taiwan Association for Human Rights, an independent non-governmental organisation, said it had not received any inquiries from Hongkongers who said they had taken part in the protests. It said potential asylum seekers in Taiwan faced an uncertain application process. The island is not a party to the United Nations’ Refugee Convention – which outlines the rights of those who are granted asylum and the responsibilities of nations granting asylum – and does not have its own legislation on refugees. “When people want to apply for asylum, they would not know if their conditions qualify or how the government would assess their case,” Wang Si, a legal specialist with the association, said.",https://scmp.com/print/news/china/politics/article/3019252/tsai-ing-wen-says-friends-hong-kong-will-be-considered-asylum

It was the second time in a week the wall in Tai Po had been defaced. The mural, near the entrance to Tai Po Market MTR station, is one of a number of Lennon Walls which have recently sprung up across the city, on which people write pro-democracy slogans or comment on the bill on colourful Post-it stickers. The controversial legislation would allow offenders to be sent to jurisdictions the city has no formal agreement with, including mainland China. Opponents fear it would led to unfair prosecutions north of the border. According to Tai Po district councillor Au Chun-wah, six coaches, which could each carry about 60 people, arrived near the MTR station at about 2am. Six to seven private cars and a truck arrived at the same time, he said. Au estimated there were about 300 people, adding that they wore masks and either black or white outfits. He said he believed some were Hongkongers and some were not, as he heard them speaking in both Cantonese and Mandarin. He said they removed lots of messages and plastic wrapping used to cover the wall, and pasted posters for a pro-establishment rally scheduled for Saturday, at Tamar Park in Admiralty. “Some people were instructing, some were watching over the situation, some were damaging, some were applying paste and some were posting papers on the wall,” Au said. Photos circulated online showed the four Chinese characters for “Lennon Tunnel”, posted at the entrance to pedestrian underpasses to the station, were replaced by the characters for “Die in one’s bed”. Those four Chinese words were used by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor when she announced on July 9 that the extradition bill was “dead”. Au said volunteers watching over the wall reported the case to police officers, who arrived at the scene soon after and tried to disperse the crowds. The group of people damaging the display left by about 3.30am. Dalu Lin Kok-cheung, a Tai Po resident who had been guarding the wall when the group arrived, said he and others had retreated because there were so many arrivals. “We didn’t have many people. Even if we did, we didn’t want to have any clashes here,” the 30-year-old said. “Someone recognised that people who led the two actions were the same,” he said. After Friday’s incident, local residents soon began restoring the wall to its previous state. Man Kwong-wing, a 69-year-old retiree who had lived in Tai Po since 1992, went to the scene to help clear up the damage on Friday morning.  “I’m here on my own initiative and do it out of my conscience,” he said. He noted the opposing group’s right to express their opinion, adding: “But you cannot damage items of the others”. Another Tai Po resident, who gave his name only as Wing, found the damage unreasonable. “You can use other ways to express your opinion, such as using memos, as Lennon Wall is a space where you can freely express your voice,” said Wing, who had volunteered to clean up the site. “But using industrial glue to cover other voices ... it seems like you are killing the voices of a place.” Named after John Lennon, the original Lennon Wall was established in the 1980s in Prague, in what was then Czechoslovakia, and was covered with graffiti and lyrics inspired by The Beatles. Other online pictures showed that pictures of opponents to the bill, including Hong Kong pro-democracy singer Denise Ho Wan-sze, legislator Claudia Mo Man-ching and Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, were also put by the wall. Floral wreaths, commonly seen at funerals, were also placed near the entrance of the pedestrian underpasses.

A small section of iron fences located around Gloucester Road, in front of The Park Lane Hong Kong hotel and Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, was removed, with orange barricade tape left in its stead, stretching for around 100 metres. A member of hotel staff said the fences were removed on Thursday morning, although the exact time it happened could not be verified. While some activists believe the fences were removed to prevent protesters from using them as barricades, a police source said it was a standard procedure to facilitate a mass public order event. “We do it from time to time whenever there is a mass rally. We removed the fences to widen the roads to accommodate more participants,” he said. It was unclear if more fences would be removed. A spokesman for New World First Bus and Citybus also said some bus stop poles had been removed in light of the upcoming protests, subject to road and traffic conditions. “For safety reasons, some movable bus stops have been temporarily taken away to avoid possible injury if the poles were to be knocked over during crowd movements,” he said. The move came after citizens vowed to escalate protest actions as the Civil Human Rights Front announced details of its Sunday march against Hong Kong’s embattled government from Victoria Park to the Court of Final Appeal in Central. Hong Kong has seen at least seven mass rallies since June. Large numbers of protesters have often remained in the streets after the marches have ended, and there have been some fierce clashes between demonstrators and police. Protesters have removed rubbish bins, railings and road signs and used them as roadblocks or thrown them at police officers. A police spokesman said that in cases of large-scale public order events on Hong Kong Island, the force adopts crowd management measures on certain sections of road and requests assistance from other government departments. Steve Vickers, CEO of a risk consultancy firm and former head of the Royal Hong Kong Police’s Criminal Intelligence Bureau, warned that the public order situation would probably worsen in the coming weeks as polarisation within Hong Kong society and intense acrimony between protesters and police deepened. “The protests are settling into a pattern of peaceful demonstration culminating in deliberately orchestrated violence, before a lull in preparation for the next ‘battle’,” Vickers said in a statement, adding that the busy calendar of demonstrations ahead heralded a ‘summer of discontent’. “Protesting in locales such as Mong Kok or Yau Ma Tei only adds to the threat of violence, given the population density and the presence of triad societies – who may act as agitators for either side, or simply take actions to protect their own interests.” He said police should set out clear and robust but fair rules of engagement, so as to ensure the safety of genuine demonstrators and to marginalise and divide agitators. “Any failure to tackle violence and make appropriate arrests will sap officers’ morale, and embolden agitators to engage in further violence.” Separately, two men were arrested for offences they allegedly committed when police headquarters in Wan Chai was besieged by extradition bill protesters on two occasions, on June 21 and 26. An 18-year-old bartender was arrested on Thursday morning for criminal damage, having allegedly spray-painted the external wall of the building on Arsenal Street during the first siege, police said. The other man, a 25-year-old construction worker, was arrested in a residence in Tai Kok Tsui on Thursday morning for assaulting a police officer during the second siege, when the officer, who was on his way to report for duty at the station was surrounded and assaulted by protesters outside, sustaining injuries to his face, waist and back.

The call on Thursday night came as rival camps geared up for another weekend of protests and marches in the city. University of Hong Kong president Zhang Xiang rejected remarks by a former lawmaker and alumnus, Alan Leong Kah-kit, that violence was sometimes justified. Zhang also said criticism of his own comments on the protests had been fair and that he needed to show the younger generation more understanding. In a forum attended by 600 students and alumni, Zhang called on those from across the political spectrum to talk to each other and learn to “agree to disagree”. “This is probably the first time in HKU and even Hong Kong, that we can sit down and talk since June,” Zhang said. Leong cited China’s founding father, Sun Yat-sen, who said in the very same hall in 1923 that his revolutionary thoughts had originated in Hong Kong. Leong urged Zhang, as part of the establishment, to avoid leaving youngsters with no option but violence. “I mention this to make the point that violence may somehow be the solution to end a problem,” Leong said. Zhang categorically rejected the argument, saying violence was never a solution in modern society. Referring to his earlier comments, made in the aftermath of protesters storming and vandalising the city’s legislature, Zhang admitted he had failed to address the young protesters’ frustrations and vowed to listen more carefully in the future. “I maintain my stance that condemning violence is the right thing to do. After two weeks, we are seeing society further polarised, things getting more violent, there’s bloodshed, a downward spiral. We have to save society, we have to end this,” he said. The 90-minute forum was generally calm, although there were cheers and jeers towards the end as some mainland Chinese students spoke of the recent row on campus and in Hong Kong. “I applied to study at HKU for its good reputation and the resources it gave me, but these past two months, I think [what has happened on] our campus is too political,” one mainland Chinese student said. Another, speaking in Cantonese, called for dialogue, but was immediately heckled when he said “We’re all Chinese”. “Hong Kong is not China!” local students shouted back. “The dialogue was frank and sincere. It’s a good start, but we need more dialogue to settle differences and the school needs to show more willingness to protect students,” graduate Liu Chun-wah said. Some pressed Zhang to categorically condemn the police handling of protests. “[Your statement] shows your lack of concern about Hong Kong, that’s not what a HKU president should have done,” one student said. But they gave credit to Zhang for appearing at the forum, saying it served as an example to their fellow alumnus and embattled Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. Respected medical professor Rosie Young Tse-tse said Lam should follow suit and talk to the younger generation. “[Lam] may be used to being an official and not like the vice-chancellor who always has to work with students,” Young said. “She should come to the young, and talk to them on an equal footing, with respect.” Chairman of the HKU Convocation Patrick Poon Sun-cheong said he would be willing to consider a forum with Lam if there were a strong enough call from alumni. Political scientist Joseph Chan Cho-wai, however, was pessimistic whether a similar “good start” of dialogue could be repeated if officials were to meet students. “The students feel there is no point meeting Lam and that she should create the environment for a dialogue,” Chan said. “If she rejects demands from the students, what’s the point of a meeting?” The call for peaceful resolution came as the city prepared for another weekend of demonstrations. The pro-establishment camp announced on Thursday that they would stage a second rally at Tamar Park on Saturday, a day before the city was expecting another huge anti-government march to take place from Victoria Park to Central. The “Safeguard Hong Kong” rally would call on residents to condemn violence and show support for the police force.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019223/university-hong-kong-president-zhang-xiang-calls-every

The anti-government protests on Sunday and next week are among a series of actions in the pipeline, including a social workers’ silent march from Wan Chai to the Chief Executive’s Office in Admiralty on Sunday, and demonstrations in Mong Kok, Western district and Tseung Kwan O on the coming weekends. Netizens said his proposal, submitted last month, would revive the worst nightmare of the bill’s opponents: bringing down the legal firewall between mainland China and Hong Kong. The issue of violence erupting after protests took centre stage again on Thursday, as organisers pledged to maintain peace and order during their marches. University of Hong Kong president Zhang Xiang had to address the issue as well, at a forum he held with hundreds of students, alumni and staff. Zhang had angered scores of them when he issued a statement on July 3 condemning the violence sparked during the storming of the legislature two days earlier, as protesters felt he was unfairly singling them out and not police. In a press conference on Thursday, pro-establishment politicians also denounced violence in the city. They said their rally at Tamar Park, near the city’s legislative and administrative centre, was to underscore and protect the city’s stability. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city’s largest pro-Beijing group, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, urged people to distance themselves from violent protests. “We respect peaceful assembly and we resolutely oppose violence and extremism, because Hong Kong will eventually suffer from that,” Lee said. Rally organiser Wong said the livelihoods of ordinary Hongkongers had been affected by protests in different districts. “We appreciate the passion of young people, but every society has its core values, and for Hong Kong, that’s rule of law,” he said. The pro-Beijing rally did not include a call to support Lam as a key message of their rally. Chaos erupted as tens of thousands of government supporters gathered in the same park on June 30 to show solidarity with the city’s embattled police force. Wong said on Thursday that while they would arrange about 1,000 marshals to maintain order at the rally, he could not guarantee there would be no chaos. “Tamar Park is an open space, everyone can go there,” he said.

The force’s inquiry about Synergy Kowloon’s plan came after warning earlier it might ban the rally over concerns about more clashes between protesters and frontline officers in the wake of recent extradition bill protests. Synergy Kowloon, which had been planning a march in Hung Hom on July 27 against large groups of tourists from mainland China in the area, said it was seeking legal advice on whether to reply as instructed, worrying that doing so would set a precedent for the government to tighten its grip on the freedom of assembly. “It is very rare for police to ask a march organiser to hand in a written response to such a long list of questions,” Lee said. “I am afraid it might be intended to raise administrative costs for all future organisers.” There were 12 questions in the first batch, following by another set of 20 questions, which police said needed to be answered for “detailed analysis”. The inquiry came after two peaceful marches last weekend, one of which – against the extradition bill – ended violently. The questions ranged from the background of the organiser, the theme of the march, the arrangement of pickets and how they might accommodate a turnout as big as 20,000, to whether they had notified different government departments along the route. Further questions related to how they would ensure marchers followed the designated route and how they would handle those who disrupted public order and broke the law. Lee said he told police they would reply on Monday. Lee founded the group with two other people in 2017, working actively in district council constituencies. He said the group had dozens of members but it was not the only organiser of the march, as many young internet users had helped out. After a meeting on Thursday afternoon, Lee said police had inquired about the organisers’ security arrangements but did not say whether the green light would be given. “If police issue a ban, we will consider expressing our opinion in other peaceful ways.” Lee said. Lawmaker Au Nok-hin, a former convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organises the annual July 1 pro-democracy march and the massive protests against the now-suspended extradition law, said the police request was unusual. “The front has never been asked to answer such a long list of questions. I am afraid the city’s freedom of assembly is being undermined and police are getting selective in approving protest marches,” Au said. “The organiser is new and has no problematic track record.” Legal scholar Johannes Chan Man-mun said it was reasonable, although rare, for police to ask for detailed analysis from organisers following clashes, but he reminded the force it had a duty to facilitate peaceful assembly and there had been a high threshold for the police force to deny a rally. Chan said as long as the organiser took reasonable steps to ensure order and deployed sufficient marshals along the rally, they could not be expected to guarantee the behaviour of each and every participant. “Police should not shift the entire responsibility of maintaining order onto the organiser – if there are no marshals to do so,” Chan said. Pro-establishment lawmaker Ann Chiang Lai-wan on Monday wrote to police chief Stephen Lo Wai-chung urging him not to grant letters of no objection to protest organisers in the interests of national security or public safety. Speaking on a radio programme on Thursday, another pro-establishment lawmaker, Chan Hoi-yan, echoed her comments. “Could we stop for a week or two to alleviate the tension?” Chan said. “I am not suggesting not approving any rallies ever again. We just need to take a break for maybe a week.” Additional reporting by Alvin Lum",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019190/hong-kong-police-demand-march-organisers-answer-32

The legislative branch of the European Union said the bill had caused fear among the people of Hong Kong that they could be subject to rendition to mainland China for political reasons. The resolution, tabled by 85 parliamentary members, called on the Hong Kong authorities to immediately release and drop charges against the peaceful protesters, and set up an independent investigation into the use of force by its police force. “They stress that the EU shares many of the concerns raised by the citizens of Hong Kong, since the bill has far-reaching consequences for the territory and its people, for the EU and for foreign citizens, as well as for business confidence in Hong Kong,” the statement said. As the parliamentary discussions were under way, China’s foreign ministry issued a statement of its own in which it accused the politicians behind the motion of hypocrisy. “The motion ignores the facts and confuses right from wrong,” the ministry’s commissioner’s office in Hong Kong said in a statement. “It is full of ignorance, prejudice and double standard hypocrisy. It is pointing fingers and making orders at the SAR [special administrative region] government and the central government’s Hong Kong policies. Their ignorance and attitude have left people speechless with astonishment and horror,” it said. “The Chinese side strongly condemns this and expresses its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition.” The cross-party, multinational motion “strongly condemns the constant and increasing interference by China in Hong Kong’s internal affairs, as well as the recent assertion by China that the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 is a historic document and hence is no longer valid”. Amid reports that Germany and Britain were considering suspending arms sales to the Hong Kong police, the European Parliament’s motion “calls for the EU, its member states and the international community to work towards the imposition of appropriate export control mechanisms to deny China, and in particular Hong Kong, access to technologies used to violate basic rights”. But the commissioner’s office said the European politicians had “turned a blind eye to the horrendous and violent acts” carried out in Hong Kong. “Do these parliament members have no sense of what’s right and wrong. Do they have minimum moral conscience, and do they have the basic concept of the rule of law?” The office said the motion had smeared the “one country, two systems” formula that allows Hong Kong to govern itself but remain part of a single China. “It reverses black and white, with ulterior motives,” it said. Eve Geddie, director of the European institutions office at Amnesty International, said: “EU member states must now immediately suspend all exports of less lethal crowd control equipment – such as tear gas and rubber bullets – that risk being used unlawfully to threaten legitimate protests.” China’s foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Hong Kong was a matter of internal affairs and outside parties should not interfere. “I call on relevant parties not to support violent acts that disturb the order of Hong Kong, or violent criminals,” he said. Among the motion’s most high-profile signatories were European Parliament vice-president Fabio Massimo Castaldo; the chairman of its foreign affairs committee, David McAllister; Lithuania’s ex-prime minister Andrius Kubilius; and former European Commission vice-president Andrus Ansip. While the resolution is non-binding, observers said it could influence EU foreign policy. “While European institutions are not obliged to follow the resolution, they often give serious consideration to the European Parliament’s proposals, and may decide to take action on the basis of the recommendations put forward,” said Sandra Marco Colino, an assistant professor of law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “The European Parliament frequently passes resolutions when there is a particularly worrying problem, with the aim of stating a joint position and putting forward some suggestions for resolving the controversy,” she said.

Opposition lawmaker Fernando Cheung withdraws his own bill to send Hong Kong murder suspect to Taiwan after it sparks fierce debate online,Cheung apologises for presenting bill at ‘sensitive time’ and admits he failed to gauge public reaction; Father of murder victim reportedly wrote to city leader Carrie Lam urging her to try alternative proposals to extradite suspect Chan Tong-kai,"5:02pm, 18 Jul, 2019","Organisers of the pro-establishment “Safeguard Hong Kong” rally steered clear of lending unequivocal support to the city’s beleaguered leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, only asking people to “give her more time” to recover from the worst political crisis facing Hong Kong.; The rally was announced as police, in a rare move, asked a small community group organising a separate march against mainland Chinese tourists in Hung Hom next Saturday to answer 32 questions on their planning and security arrangements for “detailed analysis”, after earlier protests in Sha Tin and Sheung Shui descended into violence between protesters and officers.; Protesters have called for Lam to fully withdraw the now-suspended extradition bill – which she had said was already “dead” – that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China among other jurisdictions.; On Thursday, pro-democracy lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung withdrew a short-lived private member’s bill to seek justice in the murder case that triggered the government’s legislation.; Zhang’s clarification last week that he was decrying violence committed “by any party” during the protests failed to pacify his young critics, who have accused police of using excessive force.; There were multiple confrontations as rally goers got into physical scuffles with small groups of extradition bill protesters.; Pro-police demonstrators targeted journalists on multiple occasions, verbally abusing and threatening two female reporters from the Post, prompting four media organisations to issue statements condemning the aggression.","An opposition lawmaker in Hong Kong withdrew his own bill to resolve the murder case that triggered the government’s controversial extradition bill, hours after his proposal sparked fierce debate online. Some cautioned the idea by Labour Party legislator Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, which was first submitted last month, could allow the pro-establishment camp to amend his bill and revive the worst nightmare of the bill’s opponents by removing the legal firewall between mainland China and Hong Kong. Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Cheung apologised for having presented the bill at a “sensitive time”. He also admitted to having made a mistake in gauging public reaction to his bill. “Society is on the verge of exploding; I really don’t want to see anyone harmed,” Cheung said, adding he had written to Legislative Council president Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen to withdraw the bill. But Cheung argued that his bill, which was vetted and approved by the Department of Justice on technicality, showed the government could have resolved the murder case in another way. Cheung was the third lawmaker from the opposition camp to come up with a bill to deal with the Taiwan case, in which Hongkonger Chan Tong-kai, 20, is wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Taipei in February last year. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor shot down a proposal from a pro-democracy legislator on Thursday, which similarly tried to provide a solution to the case while keeping the firewall intact. Under Cheung’s bill, the city would have been able to transfer criminal suspects to Taiwan, but not mainland China or Macau. The government’s now-suspended bill would have allowed transfers to all three jurisdictions. He admitted his proposal could arouse further controversy, after millions had marched against the government’s bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong to transfer suspects to mainland China. Cheung had also said he would not allow the pro-establishment camp or the government to “sneak in” anything to do with mainland China, by way of further amendments. “I want to say this is my own private member’s bill. If pro-establishment legislators make bad amendments [so that the bill includes mainland China], I can withdraw it at any time,” Cheung said. Under Cheung’s bill, both the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance would have been amended. Existing laws prohibit the transfer of suspects to “the Central People’s Government or the government of any other part of the People’s Republic of China”, which some have interpreted as including Taiwan, a self-ruled island. Cheung’s bill intended to change relevant clauses, so the ban only applied to “the Central People’s Government or the government of Macau”. Cheung had said his proposal would only allow transfers on a case-by-case basis, adding it would be Legco that gives the ultimate approval for any transfer. The murder case prompted Lam to push through the legal amendments in the extradition bill. She argued a legal loophole needed to be plugged so Hong Kong could extradite Chan to Taiwan. A Chinese-language media site reported on Wednesday that the father of the murder victim Poon Hiu-wing wrote to Lam last month, urging her to consider alternative proposals rather than the ill-fated bill, so that Chan could be extradited. One option would be to negotiate with Taiwan for a “one-off” extradition, Poon’s father reportedly wrote. Chan, who is currently in prison for money-laundering offences related to Poon’s murder, could be released by October. Lam’s office refused to disclose the correspondence with the father. Two other pan-democratic lawmakers, the Civic Party’s Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu and the Democratic Party’s Andrew Wan Siu-kin, had earlier submitted their own private member’s bill proposals, which involved giving local courts extraterritorial powers over crimes such as murder and genocide. Lam’s office shot down Yeung’s bill on Wednesday, saying it had issues about the retrospectivity of criminal offences and the difficulty in collecting evidence. Wan was waiting for the justice department’s reply. Yeung said he did not mind the refusal, but added the government should be making new proposals of its own. “Right now, we can only see that the government and pro-establishment legislators are doing nothing,” Yeung said. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the pro-establishment Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, had earlier suggested the government should urge Chan to turn himself in.",https://scmp.com/print/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019158/after-extradition-controversy-pro-democracy-lawmaker
